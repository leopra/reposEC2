"Vanadium One Energy Corp. is managed by an experienced team of mining professionals with extensive operating and financial experience.

?

Vanadium One Energy Corp. (VONE) is a mineral exploration company located in Toronto, Canada.  their  mandate is to acquire Vanadium and Manganese mineral projects, within North America.  These minerals are strategic minerals within the rapidly growing Electro-Voltaic and Energy Storage industries. 

 

their  plan is to define the economic potential of their  properties and define end markets for their products.  Once extracted, VONE intends to process and refine its raw materials on-site with the express intention of creating a closed-loop supply chain with end users.

 

Their  company name reflects its commitment to these “Strategic Minerals”.  The US Government includes both Manganese and Vanadium on its list of Strategic Minerals.  However, there is virtually no source of supply for either mineral within North America at this time.  Currently, these minerals must be sourced outside North America and this provides the Company with a timely opportunity to fill this unmet requirement.

 

Historically, both Manganese and Vanadium have been used in the alloying process for steel, but new markets are developing now.  Demand for both minerals is expected to grow significantly in the coming years to satisfy the new products being developed and used in the Electro-Voltaic Battery Storage industry.  Governments around the world are adopting the “Green Energy” mantra from “Renewable Sources”.  Worldwide acceptance of this pathway to renewable energy generation and the concomitant requirement for energy storage and battery technology is a certainty. 

 

Manganese and Vanadium are quickly becoming the minerals of choice to manufacture the new generation of Batteries.  Manganese will be used for the smaller segment of the rechargeable battery market in devices such as cell phones, computers, electric cars and homes.  Vanadium is perfectly placed for use in utility scale battery storage arrays."

"The Exploration Insights (EI) Newsletter is a synergistic collaboration between veteran economic geologists and equity analysts Joe Mazumdar and Brent Cook offering the sophisticated speculator a strictly independent, unbiased, and technical analysis of the junior mining and exploration sector. Our sole purpose is helping our subscribers profit from their investments. Turning Rocks into Money™ is our motto.

We are not aware of another sector that provides the opportunity for the tenfold share price increases on penny stock investments offered by the junior mining and exploration market. The mining industry is extracting millions of ounces of precious and base metals at a rate that is surpassing global reserves, and producers are in dire need to replace them with economically viable discoveries.

Mineral deposits that provide double digit returns at current commodity price levels are rare. Looking for one is a risky, expensive, and time consuming process and finding it is a 1 in 10,000 occurrence; therefore, economic mineral discoveries can be exceptionally valuable.

Once a junior exploration or prospect generator company achieves a breakthrough, its share price and market capitalization can increase dramatically. That early-discovery, high-reward spot is currently EI’s focus."

"Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. is a junior exploration company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (symbol GNG). The Company is focused on exploring and developing the gold and silver potential of an historic mining camp located in the world famous Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains of northwestern Mexico. Unlike most juniors, which have an option to earn an interest in a single property or a few scattered properties in various areas or countries, Golden Goliath controls an entire old mining camp, or district, that covers an area of 15 by 25 kilometres, with numerous past producing gold and silver mines dating back to the time of the Spaniards. Golden Goliath’s Uruachic claims are owned 100% by the Company and are fully paid for with no property option or purchase payments to make.


The Uruachic mining camp lies directly in the centre of the several hundred kilometre trend of important past producers and new discoveries that characterizes the Sierra Madre Occidental. This historic trend has produced approximately 40 million ounces of gold and up to 2 billion ounces of silver over the last 400 years and has become an area of global focus in the search for new precious metal deposits.


The town of Uruachic was founded by two Spanish explorers in 1736 (see picture of tile plaque in Uruachic town Hall) and enjoyed a long period of prosperity from the production of gold and silver. The town even minted its own silver coins ( see photos of coins: front and back ) as legal currency. Historic production ended around the time of the Mexican Revolution, as was the case with many mines in Mexico. The Uruachic area is riddled with old mine workings, perhaps more than a hundred in all. Some are small, but some are very extensive and obviously had very significant production. These mines are hosted in some of the largest and most intense alteration zones to be found in the Sierra Madres. This alteration is associated with a collapsed caldera complex, which presents extremely attractive exploration targets for large gold and silver deposits around the world."

"The Pickle Crow Gold Mine was famous in its heyday, and remains well known in the industry today.  It was among the highest grade, longest-lived underground gold mines in North America, operating continuously from April 23rd, 1935 through September, 1966 and producing in total 45 tonnes (1,446,214 Troy oz.) of gold and about 5.25 tonnes (168,757 Troy oz.) of silver from 2,785,488 tonnes (3,070,475 tons) of ore milled.  Average recovered grade over the life of the mine was 16.14 g/t Au (0.47 oz/T Au) and 1.88 g/t Ag (0.06 oz/T Ag). 


The mine established a Canadian record by paying a dividend to its shareholders a mere 11 months after beginning production.  In its first year the mine earned $415,962 (equivalent to about $6.5 million 2007 US$) after taxes and continued to earn substantial profits through World War II, labour shortages and constantly declining real gold prices (adjusted for inflation), for 28 consecutive years.  In the post-war years, under the stewardship of Dr. Norman B. Keevil, then President of PCGM, these profits from the Pickle Crow Mine partially underwrote the growth of another great Canadian mining success story, Teck Corporation (now Teck Cominco).  This outstanding record of profitability reflected in part the consistently high grades of the veins being mined, and their excellent persistence and continuity, particularly in the depth dimension."

"Alset Minerals Corporation is a resource explorer that is focused on discovering and developing high grade lithium deposits. The company’s main project is in central Mexico, where it currently has a 100% interest in seven salars containing high-grade lithium and potassium. These salars are in the states of Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi. In total, the seven salars cover an area of approximately 3,480 hectares (8,600 acres).


Alset believes that it has discovered a new lithium province in central Mexico and the company continues to aggressively pursue new acquisitions in the region. This region has a long history of mining, as it is one of the most important silver camps in the world where the mining of silver has continued since the sixteenth century.


In addition to being a mining-friendly jurisdiction, endowed with considerable mineral wealth, there is easy access to the salars with roads and power right up to the salars. It is the combination of grade, size and infrastructure in a mining friendly jurisdiction that makes Alset a unique opportunity for investors interested in the lithium space. Alset Minerals Corporation is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol ION.


In addition to lithium, the salars also contain high-grade potassium, and other chemicals that are in high demand in Mexico. Farming is an important part of the Mexican economy, much of it done by small farmers. Most fertilizer products are imported which adds to the cost that many can’t afford. Alset has the potential of having a domestic source of these strategic minerals for Mexican farmers.


Many believers in lithium predict that those first to market with new mines will be the winners and their new production will cause the price to come down. Alset’s salars are well located, high-grade lithium-potassium salars, in a mining-friendly region with impressive infrastructure with the realistic potential to be quick to market.
Regardless of how fast a company is to market, or how long their resources may last, the mining of lithium still comes down to margins.  Just like any other commodity. 
Alset has already proven the soils at their 100% owned salars are high-grade in lithium and potassium and other minerals. Leaching tests have also returned promising results.
Alset is focused on thoroughly testing the potential of their various salars in Mexico, with their unique combination of factors coming together to help Alset Minerals to reach its goals."

"Bullman’s two properties are located within the Birimian-age Siguiri Basin which underlies a portion of northeastern Guinea and southern Mali. This large basin is comprised of sedimentary and volcanic units which have been subjected to greenschist facies metamorphism. Birimian units are intruded by narrow, regionally extensive, mafic dykes and sills, and also locally by late granitic bodies.

The gold mineralization found in the Birimian units is likely to be related to late tectonic plutonism and related hydrothermal events which remobilized gold along fractures and fault zones. Two main fracture and fault zones have probably played an important role in the control of the mineralization. North-south and north-northeast structures are prominent and associated with intense ductile deformations and strong hydrothermal alteration. A strong east-northeast structure system crossing the Siguiri Basin can be interpreted; these systems have associated mylonite and intrusive bodies injected in the structures. The Mesozoic mafic dykes and sills appear predominantly controlled by east-west structures. The Siguiri Basin hosts the three producing gold mines in Upper Guinea: Siguiri (AngloGold Ashanti), Lefa Norgold/Severstal) and Kéniéro (SEMAFO), as well as two other major gold mines in neighboring Mali: Kalana (Avnel) and Kodiéran (PearlGold Mining).

A long period of weathering and deflation is reflected by extensive development of lateritic soils and saprolite horizons across the region."

"Labrador Iron Mines is engaged in the mining of iron ore and in the exploration and development of direct shipping iron ore projects (the ""Schefferville Projects"") in the central part of the prolific Labrador Trough region, one of the major iron ore producing regions in the world, situated in the Menihek area in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and in the Province of Quebec, centered near the town of Schefferville, Quebec.

The Schefferville Projects consist of the James Mine and adjacent Stage 1 deposits and Silver Yards processing facility, the Stage 2 Houston property, which includes the Malcolm 1 deposit, the Stage 3 Howse property, held in a joint venture with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Limited (""TSMC"") and, subject to further exploration and development, other iron ore properties in the vicinity of Schefferville.

LIM's Schefferville Projects are connected by a direct railway to the Port of Sept-Iles on the Atlantic Ocean and benefit from established infrastructure, including, the town, airport, roads, hydro power and rail service. LIM's Schefferville Projects comprise 20 different iron ore deposits, which were part of the original Iron Ore Company of Canada (""IOC"") direct shipping operations conducted from 1954 to 1982 and formed part of the 250 million tonnes of historical reserves and resources previously identified by IOC. These historical resources estimates are based on work completed and estimates prepared by IOC prior to 1983 and were not prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. LIM's iron ore deposits which comprise the Schefferville Projects are divided into two separate portions, one within the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the other within the Province of Quebec.

Since production commenced in June 2011, LIM has completed three operating seasons and has sold 
23 shipments totalling 3.6 million dry tonnes (3.8 million wet tonnes) of iron ore into the Chinese spot market.

LIM did not undertake any mining operations for the 2014 operating season due to a combination of the prevailing low price of iron ore, an assessment of the current economics of its deposits and a strategic shift in corporate focus towards establishing a lower cost operating framework, while concurrently negotiating the commercial terms of major contracts. LIM's current focus is seeking additional financing and completing a debt restructuring.

The Company is also working on development of the Houston Mine, to be in a position to complete construction and begin mining operations from Houston when market conditions permit, subject to completion of financing and negotiation of major contracts."

"Recently the Mining industry of Turkey is undergoing a radical change. The isolated, slow-paced sector is now more self-conscious, agile and moving forward to its objectives. Since the mine producers and non-governmental organizations are in direct contact with the government this allows them to explain their problems and opinions with face-to-face communication opportunity. With the ministry’s new policy, country’s mining gained a new momentum and the industry has renewed its hope for the future.

As you can see from the recent news in our magazine, many regulations have been made in a short period of time to bring the country’s mining industry to world standards. Significant steps are being taken in order to find solutions to the problems of the miners operating in Turkey and to pave the way for the investors who want to serve for the Turkish Mining Industry. For example planned 1 million meter drilling campaign will help to improve the potential of Turkey. In this regard, Turkey aims to take place among leading mining countries in the word.

"Metal detector (ground search) allows you to find various valuable metal items, such as: coins, jewelry, gold, electronics, wall wirings, etc. It can be useful in different areas: treasure hunting, archaeology, security. Detector is able to differentiate the metal type, so you can discriminate not useful items.

All known metal detectors incorporate big and expensive control block. Air Metal Detector utilizes user’s phone (Android or iOS) with application on it instead of control block. That allows us to make our device cheaper and more compact, while keeping all features of professional metal detectors (visible range, functions, etc.). Also, phone app gives us opportunity to create more clear and user-friendly interface. Such a design became possible here and now due to computational power and connectivity capabilities (Bluetooth) of modern smartphones. This way we can carve out new niche: affordable professional metal detectors.

At this point we already have a working prototype: the coil (with all electronics inside) and phone app. The cost of prototype turned out to be one order less than the cost of existing similar devices. By testing the prototype in the field we can argue that its quality is as good as of existing professional metal detectors: the depth of detection, the speed of response, metal discrimination."

The company changes the efficiency and economics of drilling. The company has been partnered with Shell Energy to demonstrate this disruptive technology. It uses low-cost chemical energy to accelerate consumable projectiles to hypersonic velocities, allowing projectiles upon impact to break and pulverize hard rock faster, deeper, and through a wider range of conditions. It uses this same HyperCore technology to create the Hyper Tunneling Boring and Mining system (HTBM), replacing conventional tunneling methods which typically are slow, and significant capital expense. In most cases, each consumable projectile removes over half a ton of rock per impact. 

When applied to deep geothermal energy, the drilling system allows for low-cost access to deep energy. The ""Energy Anywhere""? geothermal system generates power by quickly and efficiently reaching untapped geothermal resources and converting it into electrical energy that will cause a significant paradigm change in renewable, clean energy. 

In 2018 HyperSciences secured a contract with NASA by applying the key components of HyperCore's automated system in order to launch payloads to high-altitudes at extreme velocity. By lowering the cost for hypersonic vehicle development and a new type of stealth program, the system is prepared to support USA government contracts in the aerospace community.

The Kelly lease is approximately 40 acres in size and is located in Bakersfield Ca.  The interest to be acquired is 70% Working Interest (WI) and 56% Net Revenue Interest (NRI) and the lease contains approximately 6.7 million gross barrels of oil (mbo) in place (which equates to approximately 4.0 million barrels of oil recoverable) in five different producing zones of the China Grade formation which can be produced by a steam flood operation. Some 15 wells were drilled in the 1940’s and ‘50’s and were produced for a time. However, when oil prices plunged in the mid to late 1990’s, the operation became uneconomic and the operator of that time simply abandoned the field. The California Department of Oil and Gas assumed operations and performed abandonment procedures on the existing wells in 2002, which left most of the downhole piping in place. We believe that we can utilize these wells to serve as production wells but new steam injection wells will need to be drilled and equipped."

Who are we?
Our team includes bright, dedicated individuals from Google, NASA, Harvard, Stanford, MIT and even a Forbes 30 Under 30. We are a small, but very strong and tight-knit team and beyond just being a team, we are all good friends.

How do we do it? 
By orchestrating a series of chemical reactions, we are able to strip aluminum of a thin, naturally-occurring barrier. Once this barrier is stripped, the aluminum will freely react with water to liberate hydrogen from the water molecules.

Why is nobody else doing this?
Simple - until Trolysis came along, it has been a ""net-negative"" process. The sheer fact that it took electricity to split water (electrolysis) or remove the barrier from aluminum (pulverization) meant that the output of the system (hydrogen) would be less energy than what was put in. 

What we do differently is eliminate the need for electricity input by utilizing chemical reactions. this means you're converting chemical energy (which is abundant) to hydrogen and electricity (which are valuable and scarce)."

"The company currently has two existing projects, a 40% interest in a Feldspar mine located in the Philippines and an Anthracite Coal project located in Peru. The Feldspar mine is currently producing and is undergoing upgrades for expanded production. The operation is controlled in a Joint Venture with Paladino Management & Development Corp. The Anthracite Coal project Aim owns and/or controls through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aim Exploration SA. Furthermore, Aim is close to acquiring the rights to a Silica sand mine located in Kanab, UT. 
 
 Anthracite is the highest-ranking coal because it is older, harder, contains more carbon, has lower moisture content, and produces more energy than all other types of coal (World Coal Association). It is used industrially for metallurgy, coal gasification and liquefaction, power generation, water purification and filtration, and also for manufacturing of carbon composite materials. Anthracite is highly desirable, yet comprises less than 1% of global coal reserves. Its high carbon content of 82% to 86% makes it more cost-efficient than gas, oil or wood. Its low sulphur and volatile content makes it the cleanest-burning solid fossil fuel (Resource-Net).
 
 Aim is currently working with a firm from India (Prina Energy) that has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to purchase 500,000 MT of our anthracite annually for a five-year period. Representatives from Prina Energy have viewed the mine site, and met with key players in our logistics program and officials at the Port of Salaverry. The agreement with Prina Energy is coming at a very advantageous time. The Indian government has ambitious plans to expand the manufacturing sector, where coal is the lowest-cost base load option. India will become the second-largest coal consumer in the world, bypassing the United States, and the largest import of thermal coal."

"Our Story:
Arkoma was founded in 1983 as an oil and gas exploration company to specifically operate in the Arkoma Basin of Southeastern Oklahoma, an area in which Mark S. Kelldorf,  the founder, has spent over thirty years working as a petroleum geologist.

In 1985, the value of Arkoma’s proprietary technical database of geologic and engineering information would naturally result in the pioneering of their first private mineral acquisition program. The innovative low to medium risk investment program was established to capitalize on the existing opportunities in the Mid-Continent Region of the United States to purchase mineral, royalty and working interests. Arkoma’s guiding principle of selectively purchasing minerals and royalties through a high graded methodology enabled Arkoma to continue its involvement in the Arkoma Basin on behalf of several institutional clients who were risk adverse to oil and gas investments. Some of Arkoma’s institutional investors have included Stanford University Endowment, Austin College Endowment and JP Morgan Chase Bank (Mercantile Bank Trust).

In 1995, Arkoma transitioned into becoming its own client, retaining 100% of all producing reserves purchased through Arkoma’s in-house team of managers, geologists, engineers, landmen and business professionals.

Profile:
Arkoma Companies is a privately held group of companies based in Rockwall, Texas that is comprised of fourteen individual entities engaged in a number of business activities including real estate and energy.

For over thirty years, this conglomerate of companies has been primarily engaged in oil and gas development through the acquisition of minerals, royalties and working interests in the United States. Arkoma has been able to successfully capitalize its intellectual know-how through wisely investing, owning and operating a number of businesses engaged in asset management that offer low to medium risk investment alternatives exclusively to high net worth individuals and institutional investors.

Expertise:
Arkoma’s technical staff has an excess of thirty years experience using unique proprietary technical data which includes production history, geological studies and reserve estimates for every field where the group has acquired minerals. This information, combined with excellence in investing, enables Arkoma to continue to be a pioneer in the energy industry.

Arkoma’s turnkey approach combines both science and finance creating a business model like no other. For more than thirty years the group has successfully leveraged its core assets, which is the technical information capable of translating useful knowledge for decision-making and business innovation that is effectively applied to capitalize on investment opportunities. Arkoma Companies employs elite geologists, engineers and business professionals that are at the forefront of technical developments and investment strategies within the energy industry. The company’s research and engineering operations reflect a commitment to directly contribute to the development of the future in oil and gas innovation. Although what Arkoma has found so far is exciting, it is only the beginning. The potential is infinite."

"Long before they (The Johnson Brothers) were building mining equipment for coal miners, they were digging coal with fellow coal miners. What better credentials would a manufacturer of mining equipment need? In other words, they have ""been there and done that."" They understand the inner workings of mining equipment first hand because they have ""hands on"" experience that some manufacturers may lack. That speaks well for  the quality of equipment Johnson Industries manufactures and explains the unsullied reputation they have earned over the years.

Johnson Brothers Coal Company was established in 1974 by five Johnson brothers - Greg, Garla, Gwendel, Garnie, and George, all coming from different walks of life, but all with an innate ability to think and create. Their ability to design innovative solutions to the challenges they faced on the job paid off. The Kinney Branch Company that Garnie supervised became the highest ton per man hour coal producer in the United States. A  back injury shortened George's coal mining life, but maybe it was a ""blessing in disguise,"" because after that he devoted his time to design and production.

In 1981, they established Johnson Industries and immediately started manufacturing the industrial duty car, followed by the Super Low Tail Piece. A patented laser alignment tool for the underground mining industry (Slimm-Jim Laser) was developed next and it quickly gained industry acceptance. Johnson Industries' next proud accomplishment was the Stinger - an MSHA permissible and explosion proof personnel carrier that became a top seller in the industry. One rugged product after another has emerged from Johnson Industries, with each piece proving increased efficiency and improved safety."

"Since 2006, their company, previously known as Cotefco Energy Group, Inc., has been actively involved in the engineering, design, development, manufacturing and sale of water-in-fuel emulsification units which drastically improve performance of boilers, furnaces and engines which burn oil.

High energy costs have been a major global problem for more than forty years. Although these costs have been subject to volatility, the fundamental issue has not gone away and the impact of energy costs will continue to be extremely significant in the foreseeable future.

Particularly hard hit as the crisis has continued are industrial, residential, and institutional sectors of the economy. Many such high energy users depend on fuel-oil fired boilers, furnaces, and engines for their heating and processing needs. While much attention, funding and development work has been focused on expanded solar, wind and nuclear power possibilities, few practical alternatives are available in the foreseeable future for the reduction of fuel oil based energy costs.

At the same time as the pressing need to reduce the cost of fuel-oil requirements, another critical challenge is both the regulatory and voluntary demands to improve the environmental impact of existing and new fuel-oil heating and processing equipment.

Beginning 2010, CavitroniX™ expects to commercialize its proprietary E2C® fuel emulsion technology to a large oil-consuming market in both the United States and in foreign markets. This technology has proven its value in the lab and field applications. The best news is that it is available now."

"Patrick Harris worked with 2 solar contractors for over a year and found overhead costs were holding back solar installation contractors and a major overhead was labor and material costs.
This makes  for  “High Overhead” ( Wages,Insurance,Freight for materials, Travel time) time that was charged back to each customer.
The installation required so many panels because the maximum output was average of 240 Watts.
Large Solar Tracking systems use many panel modules mounted on very strong towers that follow the sun throughout the day. The Solar Titan can reduce the total number of these towers by producing much higher solar power with lower number of panel modules.
CASE STUDY:
The largest dual-axis tracking system currently operating in the US was commissioned  by Solar Power Partners (SPP).
With 89 tower units producing 1 MW at the West County Wastewater District (WCWD) in Mill Valley, Richmond, California, Premier Power was SPP’s EPC contractor on the 5 acre (2 ha) project. ET Solar trackers, measuring approximately 22 by 36 feet each (7 metres by 12 metres), are used at the site and the arrays contain 56 modules with a total peak power of about 11.24 kW each. The system produces approximately 1900 MWh annually, replacing some 35% of WCWD’s electricity usage.
SOLUTIONS:
If this installation had been done using the Solar Titan, they would have used only 62 tower units with each tower handling only 28 Solar Titan panels instead of the 56 standard panels.
Each tower would produce 16.1 kW instead of the 11.24 kW with standard panels.
The entire 1 MW system with only 62 tower units and 28 panels per tower unit would require 30 percent less tower units and over 50 percent less panels.
The Solar Titan may reduce the number of panels needed in an installation by ½ (Half).
Using a High Density of solar cells mounted vertical to angled collector reflectors, the Titan produces a much higher output than standard flat solar panels.
That is why the industry needs the Solar Titan."

"Tusaar is a consumer service company commercializing a metal removal water treatment technology initially. 

Tusaar was established in 2009 to commercialize a metal sequestering technology developed at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The development and research have been funded by the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy.

Most industrial and environmental waste streams contain more than a limited number of polluting metals that need to be effectively removed before the water can be safely discharged. The vast majority of current media-based technologies target a limited number of metals and operate under strict conditions. Other separation technologies need complex systems to operate and are sensitive to various contaminants regularly found in these waters.

The Tusaar technology involves the surface treatment and impregnation of granulated activated carbon with environmentally friendly organic compounds. It works in an acidic environment, targets over 40 different metals, requires minimal pre-treatment, and is simple to use. In most applications, the metals sequestered can be recovered if necessary although preliminary testing shows that metal saturated media also passes EPA mandated TCLP tests.

The technology has one issued patent and two pending. It will find application in treating industrial waste and process streams, recovering/recycling rare earth & precious metals and the sequestering of actinides.

The technology offers significant advantages in its ease of application, cost, and wide applicability."

"Gulf Manganese Corporation Limited is an Australian registered company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX: GMC) with its head office in Perth, Western Australia.

The company, through its fully owned subsidiary International Manganese Group (IMG), the 100% owner of PT Gulf Mangan Grup, plans to build the first ferromanganese (FeMn) smelting hub in Timor, Indonesia.

It has long been recognised that there are many high grade, 48% manganese outcrops in the islands of Indonesia and specifically in and around Timor including the island of Flores. Indonesian “Value Adding” laws introduced in 2009 prevent the export of minerals unless the mineral has been “upgraded” in Indonesia.Whilst there are small silicon manganese smelters in Indonesia, there is not any significant facility for the production of high grade ferro manganese alloy.
Gulf Manganese has identified the opportunity to build a ferromanganese smelting hub in Timor near the town of Kupang.
This will involve the purchase of Indonesian manganese ores at the smelter gate, processing of the ores in the smelter to a ferromanganese alloy and the sale of ferromanganese alloys to the world’s markets.The high grade of the Indonesian ores and the opportunity to source all other inputs locally including limestone, coal and iron ore more than offset the current ferromanganese alloy prices which continue to be at a low point in the cycle. The proposed smelting complex will comprise 8 furnaces to be built in stages, with a modular design. The modular facility will allow for expansion of processing facility at minimal cost.
Gulf Manganese is totally committed to the ongoing safety and welfare of its employees across all divisions of the business.
Best practice safety standards will be in place for all employees and suppliers. Gulf will be investing significantly in the development of training and education programmes for the local Kupang workforce to ensure safety procedures and standards are upheld, as well as educational programs for local miners in modern mining techniques to improve safety and reduce environmental impact."

"BCI Minerals is an Australian-based company that is developing a salt and potash business supported by iron ore royalty earnings and divestment proceeds.

BCI is focused on rapidly advancing its 100% owned Mardie Salt & Potash Project, a potential Tier 1 project located on the West Pilbara coast in the center of Australia's key salt production region.

Mardie will produce high-purity NaCl salt and sulphate of potash (“SOP”) via solar evaporation of seawater. Using an inexhaustible resource and a production process powered mainly by natural solar and wind energy, Mardie is an exciting opportunity to supply the salt and potash growth markets in Asia sustainably over many decades.

The long-term outlooks for both salt and SOP are positive. Salt is an essential mineral used extensively in modern life. High purity salt (>99.5% NaCl), which will be produced at Mardie, is used in chemical and industrial processes that create thousands of everyday products. Demand in this market segment, particularly in Asia, is expected to grow strongly over the next decade and result in a supply deficit.

Increasing population and urbanisation requires more and better-quality food to be produced from less arable land. SOP is a premium fertiliser which provides two key nutrients – potassium and sulphur – to improve crop yields and drought resistance. SOP is mostly used on high value crops where yield increases deliver larger financial benefits.

Following a positive Pre-Feasibility Study in 2018, a Definitive Feasibility Study on a 4Mtpa salt and 100ktpa SOP operation is underway and due to be completed by late 2019. Key approvals are expected to be in place by early 2020 and a Final Investment Decision is targeted by Q1 2020.

BCI receives quarterly royalty earnings from Iron Valley, an iron ore mine located in the Central Pilbara region of Western Australia which is operated by Mineral Resources Limited (ASX:MIN) (95Mt JORC Ore Reserve1). BCI’s EBITDA from Iron Valley was ~$18M in FY17 and ~$6M in FY18.

A process is underway for the divestment of BCI’s iron ore and exploration portfolio. The first transaction completed in December 2018, with the sale of the Kumina iron ore tenements to MIN for total consideration of A$35M cash, of which $8M is still to be received after operations commence."

Since 1998, during a period of sustained downturn in global uranium markets, Paladin accumulated a quality portfolio of advanced uranium projects each having production potential.

The Langer Heinrich Mine in Namibia is Paladin’s flagship project. Having reached its initial production of 2.7Mlb U3O8 per annum in 2008, the mine completed its Stage 2 ramp-up to 3.7Mlb per annum in the 2010 financial year. Subsequently, the Company has completed a Stage 3 expansion and is now producing at a 5.2Mlb per annum rate.
