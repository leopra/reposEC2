"checkrobin.com is the first online platform for transportation that effectively connects individuals in order to create a powerful network that allows for simple, flexible and rapid shipping of goods of any kind at any time.

All over Europe thousands of cars are on the road on a daily basis - most of them with plenty of free luggage space that currently remains unused. Our mission is to change this. checkrobin.com aims at revolutionizing the same-day-delivery market by connecting commuters to people in need of fast and easy transport. After finding each other and agreeing on the main terms via the platform, sender and driver can discuss the final details via phone or instant messaging, a win-win-win situation. The sender gets fast and easy delivery of his goods, the driver earns himself a commuting allowance (9 to 29 euros) and the environment benefits as well, as packaging is not required and goods are transported without extra carbon-dioxide emission.

Until checkrobin.com it was almost impossible, or at least uneconomical, to realize same-day-delivery outside urban areas. Using commuters to facilitate the transport, our platform is able to change this and by that tap into a new, highly attractive market."

"The Hypersphere HS-5k system for continuous surveillance represents a disruptive innovation for two major fast- growing industries - unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing.

With per-flight-hour expenses ten to fifteen times lower than other unmanned systems in the same class, the HS-5k system enables a considerable increase in profitability of the use of the unmanned aerial systems in public and commercial domains, as well as a significant market application expansion.

Furthermore, in the remote sensing industry the price per square kilometre for a very high resolution image (e.g. 20 cm/px) is more than 200 times higher than the production expense of the equivalent remote sensing date obtained through the HS-5k system.

Numerous other conceptual, technical and business advantages give this product an edge over existing solutions in the aforementioned industries.

The Hypersphere HS-5k system for continuous surveillance is comprised of a MALE UAV - unmanned aerial vehicle with extended endurance (24 to 100 hours of continuous flight, depending on the environmental conditions), and of the communication and ground infrastructure required for providing the field information in real time. The HS-5k system supports a wide variety of continuous surveillance missions, and is at the same time less expensive to use than any existing equivalent solution, based either on unmanned or manned aircrafts, or just on the ground surveillance infrastructure.

In short, HS-5k currently provides the best continuous surveillance service in the world."

"CargoSteps is a platform for automated backloads in B2B express and courier logistics built on a cross company real-time track & trace solution that provides proactive status updates.

Processes with SMEs in logistics are very time and cost intensive. The need for transparency and real-time status updates of shipments in the time critical express and courier market is very strong. Also 95% of car to van sized vehicles in this market are driving back empty after delivering a shipment, because those SMEs have only a small regional network that provides them with jobs and with the high pace in this time critical market, they can't organize backloads in time.

An essential USP of CargoSteps is the cross company functionality with multiple parties of every size. Small companies usually have no system at all for their daily work and medium sized companies in this market have only isolated solutions that can't be used with their partners and subcontractors. With CargoSteps they can work with any company worldwide in less than 2 minutes. This opens completely new possibilities like the automated marketplace for backloads which you only have with slow and time uncritical general cargo shipments for big trucks with a minimum shipment size of one pallet. Everything below that gets ignored. CargoSteps on the other hand focuses on shipment sizes usually below a pallet but doesn't exclude any larger shipments.

With CargoSteps' marketplace companies can improve their turnover about 50% while improving their service and freeing resources with the track & trace solution."

"Kohler-Transfer top 3 cross-regional service providers of transportation for the disabled in Germany. In three federal states, Kohler employs well over 2,100 employees and maintains a fleet of around 1,500 vehicles.

Kohler's vision is to increase the mobility of people who are ill or disabled and to establish this transport service as the largest cross-regional specialist. People with reduced physical and mental capabilities are being enabled to participate in daily life through door-to-door transportation to schools and workshops.

Kohler enters into long-term contracts with establishments that focus on the promotion and integration of disabled people. Essentially, this comprises sheltered workshops, day support facilities and schools for disabled people, the contractual partners mainly being public bodies (state welfare, administrative districts and towns) and charitable associations or clubs (German Caritas Association, Diakonie (social and welfare arm of the Protestant Church in Germany), Workers’ Welfare Association). 

The in-house route planning software tailored to the business processes contributes to optimizing cost and capacity utilization as well as increasing efficiency. The in-house software and database are used to handle the operational and logistical business areas as well as customer billing, personnel planning and payroll accounting. The efficiency of the service provider in relation to transportation for the disabled constitutes an essential success factor in public tenders.

A further success factor is the company’s own vehicle fleet, which complies with current DIN and ECA standards and whose age structure is no more than 6 to 8 years. Using vehicles that comply with current standards and requirements is a basic prerequisite in the context of public tenders. 

Apart from the appropriately equipped transport vehicles, the employees on permanent contracts with, and trained by, Kohler are the main success factor. Day-to-day activities give rise to close bonds between the employees and the people in need of transport which not only enrich the professional approach to disabled people, but, in particular, facilitate the necessary interpersonal interactions."

"VikingCars was founded in early 2014 with headquarters in Reykjavík, Iceland.

It was founded by two young Icelandic entrepreneurs who strongly believe in the future of peer to peer services, one of them being car sharing.

Apart from housing, a car is usually the most expensive investments families make. A car is costly to own and maintain and often it´s use is limited. That is why they have created a platform where people can share their cars in a safe way. This will help car owners to make some income to make it less costly to own a vehicle and it will help renters to rent a more personalized car at more affordable prices.

Many families in Iceland have two cars so sharing is a great opportunity while the car is not in use, especially during the summer. This is great as during the summer travellers are looking for special vehicles to travel in. By connecting those two groups together they can reduce the numbers of cars on the road and increase the use per car. By using the VikingCars platform they will therefore reduce traffic congestion, parking scarcity, material waste and pollution.

When travelling it is important to do something different and unique that you will remember. Icelanders have a unique car culture where Icelanders often modify their vehicles to better suit the Icelandic mountain environment. Some do drastic changes such as extra fuel tanks and special off-road equipment, while others only make minor changes like slightly larger tires. The VikingCars marketplace has unlimited opportunities for Icelanders to share their unique vehicles with travellers which want to try something different."

"OnTruck is a platform that is based on the use of new technologies to offer companies regional merchandise transport services, through an immediate and transparent price management system. OnTruck puts companies in contact with a wide network of professional carriers, in order to provide a reliable and efficient delivery service, and with the possibility to check in real time the status of each shipment. For their part, carriers can receive orders and accept them if they wish through a free application, so that they can complete the loading of their vehicles and increase their income.

For the creation and implementation of OnTruck, its founders allocated 100,000 euros, although friends and family soon wanted to participate, with an investment of 500,000 euros. In October 2016, they closed a first round of financing worth 2 million euros, in which Point Nine Capital, based in Berlin, participated; the British fund Local Globe; and Samaipata Ventures. In May 2017, a second round of financing of 9.2 million euros led by Atomico took place, followed by the French fund IdInvest, and the venture capital arm of the company, also French, Total Energy. In May 2018 they received their third round of financing worth 25 million euros, led by the Cathay Innovation fund, followed by Atomico, Idinvest Partners, All Iron Ventures, Total Energy Ventures, GP Bullhound.

The startup, which is focused on the regional palletized merchandise transport service, currently operates in two countries: Spain and the United Kingdom. In Spain it is present in the downtown area (Madrid and neighboring provinces), Catalonia and the Valencian Community. In the United Kingdom it operates in London and in the Southeast area of ??the country. 

Yours is a simple, transparent and effective service. On the one hand, it provides an immediate way to access their prices, simply by entering the web and quoting shipping. Any company can schedule a shipment for free and hire in less than two minutes a load of any dry or refrigerated merchandise on local or regional routes in the areas it currently operates. The transport can be for that same time or scheduled, that is, the typical services of 24h and 48h, which means that they can pick up any palletized goods in less than 30 minutes. They are also very competitive in price within their sector, becoming up to 50% cheaper compared to the rates that are usually handled in the sector.

On the other hand, OnTruck are firmly committed to optimizing the use of industrial vehicles by generating routes. Its technological solution seeks to capture the inefficiencies that are generated in the regional transport of goods when you combine and execute a high volume of loads in a very defined geographical area and generate opportunities for routes that reduce the number of kilometers that vehicles in our network make in empty."

Problem: 
Although carriers with fleets of 20 trucks or less make up over 92% of all trucking companies in the United States, they must compete with larger fleets without the benefit of the premium-priced software tools and economies of scale savings available to their more resourced competitors.

"Ireland’s first commercial garage, Peare Motor Works was established in Waterford in 1900 by W.F. Peare (1868-1948). A Watchmakers son, Peare commended building motorised quadricycles in 1899, and the following year, in partnership with Alderman William Goff, founded Peare’s Motor Works. 

The first car sold by the new company, a French De Dion Buton, was purchased by Goff (later Sir William), and it is highly probable that this De Dion was the first motor car imported into Ireland. Peare’s became the country’s best known “car doctor” and motorist from near and far brought their vehicles to Waterford for repair and service. In 1901 the company began building motorised tricycles, and was almost certainly the first Irish concern to assemble and build a motor vehicle of any kind. By 1903 the number of motor cars in Ireland had risen to 236. Peare’s Motor Works expanded along with this growth, and a Cork branch was opened in 1913. 

Difficult trading conditions during the First World War brought about a down in Peare’s fortunes. Bill Peare’s absence – he was by then a Captain in a Motor Transport unit in Italy – took its toll and in 1917, the business was forced into liquidation. A local businessman, John Kelly bought the company and commenced trading again before the end of 1917. In 1928, a new company, John Kelly (Waterford) Ltd. was formed to promote and develop the business. The following years saw the rapid expansion in Ireland’s motor trade, and the new company kept pace with that growth."

Nito is solutions for city mobility based on concepts of flexibility and energy savings.
"Idro Meccanica compressors are hydraulically driven. The oil and the gas sections are separated by a short single-compartment distance piece vented to the atmosphere. The vent lines for oil and gas could be collected and checked from time to time to control the status of the seals. The gas section is non-lubricated and due to the separation and the double seals, the oil carry-over is virtually none.

The flexibility of the hydraulic system helps in having compressors and boosters that could accept a wide range of inlet pressures. Some of our units could also be used as compressor/boosters to fill and then intake gas from a high-pressure storage in order to achieve high flow-rate in a direct fill.

The booster compressor is also the most suitable solution for daughter refueling stations as they do not need to reduce the pressure from the mobile storages being able to accept a wide inlet pressure range.

Idro Meccanica compressors could have a maximum of five stages in one cylinder. The best-sold models are two and three stage compressors/boosters.

Most of the units could also be supplied in twin version with two compressors assembled on the same frame in order to reduce installation space. The twin solution could also be used with two different models in order to combine a booster with a low-pressure compressor.

The selection of the correct model is usually carried-out together with the potential customer taking into consideration the type of gas, available inlet pressure, required outlet pressure and rate of flow.

Most of the units could be tailored to the customers’ needs with just small modifications from our main PED certified standard models (more than 50)."

"The parent company Ferrovie dello Stato SpA is 100% owned by the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance, and controls the operating companies in the four industrial sectors: transport, infrastructure, real estate services and other services. All the companies nevertheless maintain their own company characteristics and are run autonomously in pursuing their respective business objectives.

Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, while leaving the autonomous legal responsibilities of the companies in which it holds shares unchanged, mainly carries out company type activity which is typical of a holding company (management of the subsidiaries, share ownership, etc..), as well as industrial type work. Through a system of Central Directorates, the parent company also sets strategic approaches and ensures the orientation and the coordination of the industrial policies of the operational companies.

Leader in passenger rail transport, with 88% market share, and freight, with 7%, the FS Italiane Group has about 74,200 employees, 8,000 trains running per day, more than 830 million passengers per year, and 50 million tonnes of goods per year. The railway network includes over 16,700 km of tracks, of which about 1,000 km are dedicated to high-speed services.

The FS Italiane Group aims to become the enterprise system that implements integrated and sustainable mobility and logistics services by exploiting synergistic transport infrastructures, thus creating value in Italy and abroad. In 2016, the FS Italiane Group confirmed its excellent performance, achieved over the past years, by reaching impressive financial results and profits of €772 million, never before achieved by the company.

On 1st December 2016, the CEO of the Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Renato Mazzoncini was unanimously elected as President of the Union Internationale des Chemins de fer (UIC), the association which represents the railway sector at a global level. The election recognises the commitment of the group in developing the railway sector and the ability to best represent its interests. It also means an important milestone for the Italian system, which will have the chance to influence the creation of transport policies at a global level, in one of the most strategic industries for investment and in terms of the impact it has on people and a country's economy. The UIC will also be called upon to play the vital role of consultant and advisor for the large investment programmes which are currently under way, or are scheduled for the next few years around the world: from the TEN-T European corridors (passengers and freight) to China, the US, India and Russia.

Another important stage in the renewal process has been the introduction of the new Busitalia Fast service, which was presented in April in Berlin on the occasion of the sector's international trade fair Bus2Bus 2017. It offers competitive transport services at a domestic and European level, with high levels of safety and innovation. Created with the aim of becoming the main European player in long-distance mobility by bus, the service runs daily service to 15 Italian regions and over 90 cities in Italy and Germany, with a fleet of 60 latest-generation buses.

And then during 2017, the FS Italiane group's rail freight transport and logistics services changed radically with the launch of the Polo Mercitalia, a single, large hub that brings together the group companies that operate in this area (Mercitalia Logistics, Mercitalia Rail, Gruppo TX Logistik, Mercitalia Intermodal, Mercitalia Transport & Services, Mercitalia Shunting & Terminal, TerAlp and TLF).

On 29 December 2017, Anas joined the FS Italiane Group, contributing to the establishment of the first integrated rail and road hub in Europe for serving residents and investing €108 billion over the next ten years.

However, the FS Group doesn't just limit itself to national borders. As the number one European railway company for profitability, the Company exports Made in Italy excellence for the development of railway networks all over the world: the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Latin America, USA, India, and Australia.

"Walle Mobility was born from the idea of Domenico Gagliardi in December 2019. The idea behind Walle Mobility is to allow air travel in a simple and fast way, in just one click. Walle’s mission is to revolutionize urban and interurban mobility in the next 10 years, operating within the UAM (Urban Air Mobility) market, in strong worldwide expansion. Walle’s mission is to eliminate traffic and allow movements first interurban and then urban avoiding hours and hours of traffic from the city.

We want to start with Milan. Milan is one of the most mature cities in Europe as sharing mobility. From 2004 until today, Milan Municipality signed agreements with seven car-sharing operators, eight scooter-sharing operators, and three bike-sharing operators.

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is going to be a real opportunity and we would like to launch the service during Milano – Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Air Mobility would be the best solution to smartly move both athletes and wealthy travelers between different areas of cities.

FLY - Since the beginning, our goal has been connecting ground-to-air with a click: so-called “taxi drones” have been included in our project. Nowadays UAM is just a project, an idea, and taxi drone services seem to be only a product of an SCI-FI writer but, then: why are we considering it? As said above, UAM offers incredible potential and a revolutionary scenario of travel between cities and suburbs. People&#39;s minds will soon be ready, authorities are working towards it, manufacturers are building, testing and certifying their aircraft while Walle is… already there.

We want to be one of the first UAM service providers in the world because we strongly believe that this method of transportation, will allow both passengers and goods to travel very quickly through the cities with a fraction of relative costs. As part of the business model, we will be also renting the facilities like vertiports to other operators that will come afterward.

By 2050 we will be ten billion on Earth! Of these 10 billion, almost seven billion will live in urban centers. Imagine the cities of the future. Imagine the links between regional cities and imagine the traffic! The biggest problem in the cities of the future will be one: traffic.

Imagine the traffic pollution. Imagine the travel between one city to another that will become slower and slower. This problem will be very dangerous also for the people who will use your car for regionals travel. Cities link will be slower and the stress will growth."

"Space debris is a resource.  CisLunar Industries is developing the technology to recycle and reuse it in space. Transforming the economics of space debris clean-up. Accelerating the adoption of in-space manufacturing. Building the foundations of an industrial cislunar economy.


Overview: 
CisLunar Industries, a space technology startup, is creating an industrial scale, space-based metal refining and production capability in cislunar space. By redefining space debris and treating it as the optimal near-term resource for in-space metal production, the company will open the market for space-sourced structural materials.

To achieve this vision, the company is developing a group of orbital platforms called Space Foundries that will recycle space debris and non-functioning spacecraft to produce refined metal and salvaged components, massively impacting two areas: 


(1) By making space debris valuable, active debris removal becomes a potentially profitable activity,  and space debris remediation/mitigation becomes economically self-sustainable.

"Hyper Poland develops the next generation of High-Speed Railways (HSR), based on magnetic levitation, linear motor and autonomous control systems, which can be subsequently transformed into a vacuum version. It is the only company globally working on technology enabling a gradual implementation of Hyperloop-inspired solutions as an upgrade for the railway industry.
The company has developed a unique, patent-pending magrail technology, which allows modernizing existing conventional railway lines to a standard of passive magnetic railways, reaching speed of  300 kph (186 mph) on normal lines and 415 kph (258 mph) on HSR lines. The magrail system allows keeping the functionality of conventional railways on a modernized line (railway operators can depreciate their existing rolling stock).

Magrail can be subsequently transformed into a vacuum system – hyperrail, reaching speed of 600 kph (373 mph) on normal lines and 1000 kph (621 mph) on HSR lines.

The third generation is hyperloop – vacuum magnetic railways built within new transportation corridors for top speed of 1200 kph (746 mph), using subsystems tested in the first two generations.

Capex for retrofitting railway infrastructure to a magrail standard are estimated to ca. EUR 6-8 million per km, which is comparable to the cost of building a new highway and up to 60-70% lower than the average cost of building a new HSR line in the EU.
Energy costs will be lower by ca. 13% for the speed of 300 kph (186 mph) compared to HSR, whole for the speed of 415 kph (258 mph) magrail needs the same amount of energy than HSR currently for 300 kph (186 mph). The maintenance costs will be ca. 25% lower than for HSR, due to elimination of friction of mechanical elements at high speeds.

The company was founded in 2017 and until mid-2019 it submitted 8 patent applications. In the first half of 2019 it secured an EUR 3.8 million grant in Poland and raised EUR 334 thousands during the first Polish equity crowdfunding campaign on a UK-based platform Seedrs. 
Currently a Proof of Concept (PoC) is almost completed (ca. 50 m. long test track, which will be demonstrated in Q4.2019)., while at the turn of 2020 and 2021 a demonstration of the first full-scale prototype is planned.

Corporate partners include TME Transfer Multisort Electronics and Microsoft.

"Train Alliance Sweden AB's mission is to provide long-term industry partners with modern and efficient building facilities for rail-related businesses in terms of infrastructure and logistics. The company works in close cooperation with operators and rental tenants to provide highly efficient building facilities and opportunities for direct cost saving.

They offer a combination of sound finance and industrial know-how where their buildings and facilities maintain the highest and most modern technical standards coupled with a strong environmental awareness. They put great emphasis on efficiency and the opportunities for significant cost savings. Beyond this they offer their customers economically smart solutions through their own business model called Fortness.

Train Alliance Sweden AB assumes total responsibility all the way from construction to long-term management through a combination of sound finance and industrial know-how.

Having an experienced organization working within construction and project management means that they not only know how to work in any geographic location but that they do so to the highest standards and at the lowest cost. This is summarized in their founding philosophy the ""BPC"" model:

- Building expertise and quality
- Placement and strategic location
- Concept and capacity in engineering solutions

In the introductory phase of a project they complete a capacity and efficiency study based on such parameters as work flow, capacity, equipment, consolidation, etc. The study analyzes how investment-related earnings affect the tenant's total costs both in terms of capacity and efficiency. This can lead to major savings in maintenance costs, create greater openness, tie up less capital, generate more efficient use of railway vehicles and repair services, particularly through greater flexibility and less transport between trains etc.

Directly after the introductory phase Train Alliance offers long-term stable returns through the provision of efficient operations and management. As a lessor they are clearly concerned and willing to engage in investments and always offer the highest and most modern technical standards available in the industry.

Train Alliance Sweden AB is unlike a traditional finance company and its business agenda is to work closely with its clients and tenants to meet the needs of flexible and long-term solutions. The tenant maintains the disposition of the engineering capacity, this is a crucial parameter allowing them to develop and adapt their premises and at the same time retain the flexibility that tenancy involves. By combining the demand for long-term business with effective financing and leasing arrangements, Train Alliance has created a valuable new market for the maintenance of rail-related properties. The method can also be applied to other industries - It is a business model called Fortness.

In the Fortness model the operator determines the basic foundation of any project, takes in offers and implements construction. After completion, Fortness AB acquires the property and the operator is offered partial ownership. Owning a stake helps to create a sense of security, long-term oversight and indirect inspection protection through regulations under the Companies Act for minority owners and partnership protection on various levels. The tenant makes a profit, as they are able to ensure long-term stable rents by leasing on an operating basis. Over time this makes it possible to price their services without risking their margins. Oversight is maintained whilst investment is largely removed from the operator's balance sheet thus freeing up the scope for working capital. Fortness also provides the operator with the ability to make a profit on the property as the merger is concluded at a fair market value after the construction is finished."

"The automotive industry is more destructive than it needs to be. The vehicles we drive today are extremely harmful to our planet and even our health, with vehicle emissions causing more premature deaths than car accidents. These numbers are even more extreme in cities, which host 54% of the world’s population, a number that continues to grow. People in cities have become accustomed to the toxic smell, but these emissions are completely unnecessary and cause critical problems that must be addressed, such as a recent study that showed a direct link between emissions and clinical mental health problems in children. This is especially troubling when you consider that only 2-3% of the energy burned in cars today actually moves its passengers. The average vehicle weight is 1.8 tonnes, while the average occupancy per vehicle trip is only 1.2 people, and 80% of these vehicle trips are less than 25km.

"Avionero is developing the next generation flight search service. This service is inspired by the vast unmet needs of modern travelers who are left frustrated and abandoned in their search for personalized flight travel options online. The existing flight search engines (e.g. Skyscanner, momondo) are based on the logic, technology and UX created back in the ‘90s. This means that they a) are built on the predetermined assumptions about the behavior of the user (e.g. assuming that a user visiting the platform already has their travel destination and dates in mind) and b) drastically limit flight search personalisation opportunities through outdated technological frameworks. As a result, user trust in the search engines is low, while the frustration is high.

Avionero is well positioned to break this paradigm. It has developed and pre-validated (TRL-6) the first prototype of the flight search service that truly puts the user in the driving seat while searching for their dream flight travel online. With the combination of powerful AI technology and an easy-to-use interface, Avionero provides a much convenient flight search service. While leaving the user in control, its smart system gives them the freedom to efficiently explore and personalize."

This is a common fact that the price of imported charging stations including all recent taxes is deterrent.J

Another great advantage is that we have a warranty for our products. GreenFuel hardware is always in stock and this allows us to solve all the issues concerning its repair in a very short term without fuss for our clients.

We produce charging stations for electric cars based on our own charging controller in this hard time for Ukraine in hope that our products will help our country to become less dependent from imported oil and gas resources.

Production facility and service center for charging stations located in Kiev, Ukraine. At the beginning of 2016 production capacity is 1000 - 1200 standard charging stations per year."

"People today expect to hop into a car within minutes of ordering one, whatever the time of day or night. They expect their packages to arrive the next, or even the same day. It all relies on drivers, and means that owning a car opens up a world of earning potential.

But not everyone has access to the right kind of car. That’s where Splend comes in. To date, we’ve helped people from all walks of life become their own bosses, with not just a car, but the tools to earn even more money, and become better drivers.

Splend was launched in Sydney in 2015 after our founder, Chris King, realised that too many drivers were lacking both the cars and knowledge they needed to really thrive. It was a problem, but it could be fixed.

Now, four years later, Splend is able to offer freedom to all kinds of people through car rental, and rent-to-own options. But we don’t stop there. We provide unprecedented levels of support and training, to help our members make the most of their time on the road.

And, by providing members with data and analytics, we give them the opportunity to become more profitable and safer drivers. All that, plus the chance to connect with other drivers and be part of a growing community, making driving a more sustainable way of earning an income.

Splend has enabled students, retirees, former refugees and single parents to find work they enjoy, and that fits their lifestyle. Equally, we’ve provided exciting opportunities for first-time buyers to own a brand new car. We couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re only just getting started.

Whatever your reason for wanting a car, Splend has it covered, with all of the support you need to turn your dream into a reality."

"Increasing urbanisation is posing significant problems to many of the worlds cities, especially the very largest megacities whose infrastructure cannot cope with the demand for transport by millions of users daily.
A Transit Exchange is a means to rationalise contended access to any “transportspace” (roadspace, waterway or airspace system) based on the construct of a commodity futures exchange. Most simply it enables real-time, dynamic ridesharing on a very large scale in any type of vehicle which carries passengers or freight.
Using mathematical optimisation techniques (based on heuristics and genetic algorithms) the Transit Exchange examines and aggregates origin-destination requests for transport from dispersed users in both space and time (who may or may not know one another) and applies operational concepts and knowhow garnered from successful prior deployments, Texxi provides a relevant trip package suggestions for ridesharing to those users and the vehicle operators in the locality.
The Transit Exchange also generates income for municipal road operators from the very market making functions used to fill the empty seats in the fleet or vehicles operated in the “transportspace”. Now congestion pricing, road pricing and vehicle pricing charges can all be applied to users and a negative congestion charge implemented so as to not adversely affect the poorest in society.
Predictive Analytics permit the transport users to choose when to travel and the transport service providers to place their assets in the most logical positions to best serve demand.
If an investor was to deploy an amount of money into the Transit Exchange, then through the market making protocols in solving NP-hard problems related to Large Scale Dynamic Real-time Ridesharing a set of returns with varying yield-to-maturities can be replicated, providing an alternative to money-market funds and instantiated through the mechanism of a blockchain coin offering.
Rather than relying on the rather nebulous promise of perpetual cryptographic security of a blockchain ledger, the provable work done has solved a pressing and current problem in the real world and done so in a manner that was transparent.
High Liquidity investable security instruments (Transit Exchange Bill or TE-Bills) can thus be made available via the Transit Exchange. Its original purpose. To store value represented by demand for travel in a locality.
Hence we will have a computational-crypto-currency backed by a commodity called “transport demand”.
From 1968 - 2010, many academics in many of the top Universities in the world said that dynamic, real-time, ridesharing was not yet possible. Texxi proved it was possible in 2006 and in 2008, using the idea of a futures exchange, a dynamic social network map and genetic algorithms to solve an otherwise intractable solution.

"In 1988 Steve Bushell recognised a need in the Commercial Vehicle Industry for larger and specialised fuel tanks, so with a workforce of only three based in a two bay workshop, SB Components was formed.

The 1990’s was a period of expansion and by year 2000 revenues had grown to £2.5 million. A significant investment was made in Millennium Works, a purpose built premises of 30,000 square feet to accommodate the growing business.

In 2007 Truck Logic was acquired and fully integrated within our existing operation and facilities, bringing the total workforce to over seventy with a turnover of £7 million.

With an increase in demand from customers outside of the UK a new partnership started with Dutch colleagues and in 2009 a joint operation called SB Europe was created in Holland. SB Europe continues to grow with markets in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Holland.

As the company’s reputation for quality and service continued to grow within the Commercial Vehicle Industry, and with an ever increasing customer base, the management team took a decision to break into a whole new sector and in 2011 a further building and new workforce were put in place to create a fully dedicated production space for high quality and durable bodies for the 3.5T to 26T market. This increased production capacity to 43,000 square feet with a workforce of a hundred people and a turnover of £10 million.

With high profile customers such as John Lewis, DHL, Tesco, SIG and TNT, new premises were leased in 2014 to form a dedicated Fleet Application Centre. This added an additional 6,000 square feet of capacity specifically for fleet work.

In November 2014 we completed a six bay 5000 square feet workshop extension to our existing main site which included a single axle digital weighbridge to accommodate new European Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA) legislation which was recently introduced within the Commercial Vehicle Industry. We are proud to say that with a vast amount of dedication and further investment we continue to offer our customers a product range that now meets type approval legislation, including all of our body conversions from 3.5T to 26T.

With a total production capacity of over 60,000 square feet across three sites, a workforce of around 130 people, and an annual turnover of £15 million the company has continued to grow successfully into one of the leading businesses of its kind in the UK and with a committed and dynamic team we plan for an exciting and positive future for both ourselves and our customers."

"Tevva Motors Ltd is a UK-based, leading developer of modular electrification systems for medium duty commercial vehicles. 
Using a systems engineering approach, Tevva has developed world-class electric vehicle technology that adheres to the most rigorous of standards to ensure safety, reliability and durability.
Tevva’s core proprietary technologies – comprising battery pack and management system, control system, software and optional range extender – are applicable to almost any current 7.5t – 14t truck and is supplied as a package to OEMs for integration with their vehicles.
In order to support the development of the technology and demonstrate the cost savings possible by their use, Tevva is working with a cohort of early customers to produce a fleet of rental vehicles for use by logistics companies.
The four technology pillars offered by the company, which can be used either together or individually, comprise the following:
•	Tevva Power – Battery packs, bespoke battery management system and power control system that regulates the flow of energy from and to the batteries
•	Tevva Link – cloud-based software that controls, links and optimises all of the onboard technologies including autonomous engagement of the range extender and also offers performance diagnostics
•	Tevva Drive – drive system that delivers greater control of torque delivery and utilises the efficiency of regenerative braking to harvest energy that goes back into the battery system
•	Tevva ReX – optional range extender that offers more flexible functionality and eliminates range anxiety
The range extender and patented, cloud-based Predictive Range Extender Management System (PREMS) ensures that the vehicle always completes its duty cycle and that daily energy usage is optimised whilst also lowering total cost of ownership and minimising emissions.
The standard 150kWh Tevva electric motor produces 2,000Nm of torque and delivers a range of around 120km a day, based on typical urban distribution duty cycle. 
For back-to-base distribution businesses with out-of-town depots, the range extender and PREMS system not only ensure that range anxiety is eliminated but also uses geofencing technology to autonomously engage pure electric or range extender mode depending on whether or not the vehicle is in urban or Clean Air Zones.
Early series production is underway and manufacture upscaling is proceeding. For more background on Tevva’s growth see https://tevva.com/growth-timeline/. For the latest news see https://tevva.com/news and visit https://tevva.com/investor-relations/."

"Infrastructure projects are becoming ever-more sophisticated, requiring the integration of more and more technologies and disciplines. At the same time, they are also becoming more democratic, with the input of increasingly diverse stakeholder groups.

These should be positive trends, but tools and techniques for planning, design, and project management have not kept pace. As a result, they are increasingly unable to deal with the complexity of modern infrastructure projects, resulting in large-scale cost overruns and delays.

Podaris solves this problem. It is a platform for realtime interdisciplinary planning and design of infrastructure projects, putting collaboration and transparency front and centre. Using the power of modern cloud-collaboration techniques, Podaris will enable infrastructure planning to be a far more agile process, reducing the communications gaps between disciplines from months to milliseconds.

"When Triumph Engineering went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver.[2] The new company's manufacturing plant and its designs were not able to compete against the Japanese, so Bloor decided against relaunching Triumph immediately. Initially, production of the old Bonneville was continued under licence by Les Harris of Racing Spares, in Newton Abbot, Devon, to bridge the gap between the end of the old company and the start of the new company. For five years from 1983, about 14 were built a week in peak production. In the USA, owing to problems with liability insurance, the Harris Bonnevilles were never imported.[3]

Triumph 900cc Adventurer, first variation of the popular Triumph Thunderbird 900 triple
Bloor set to work assembling the new Triumph, hiring several of the group's former designers to begin work on new models. The team visited Japan on a tour of its competitors' facilities and became determined to adopt Japanese manufacturing techniques and especially new-generation computer-controlled machinery. In 1985, Triumph purchased a first set of equipment to begin working, in secret, on its new prototype models. By 1987, the company had completed its first engine. In 1988, Bloor funded the building of a new factory at a 10-acre (40,000 m2) site in Hinckley, Leicestershire.[4] Bloor put between £70 million and £100 million into the company between purchasing the brand and breaking even in 2000.

At the same time as production capacity increased, Bloor established a new network of export distributors. He has previously created two subsidiary companies, Triumph Deutschland GmbH and Triumph France SA. In 1994, Bloor created Triumph Motorcycles America Ltd.[4]

At 21.00 hours on 15 March 2002, as the company was preparing to celebrate its 100th anniversary as a motorcycle maker, its main factory was destroyed by a fire which began at the rear of the facility. At the height of the blaze, over 100 firefighters were tackling the fire, which destroyed most of the manufacturing capacity.[5] Nevertheless, the company, which by then employed more than 650, quickly rebuilt the facility and returned to production by September that year.

In May 2002, Triumph began construction on a new sub-assembly manufacturing facility in Chonburi, Thailand to make various components.[6] A second factory was opened in 2006 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York where a wet painting facility and assembly line have been established.[6][7] A third factory was opened in 2007 to include high pressure die-casting and machining, and Triumph announced that they were expanding to increase capacity to over 130,000 motorcycles.[8] Triumph Motorcycles (Thailand) Limited is a 100% UK owned company and now employs about 1000 staff.[6]

The Triumph Group announced sales of 37,400 units in the financial year ending 30 June 2006. This represented a growth of 18% over the 31,600 produced in 2005. Company turnover (revenues) rose 13% to £200 million ($370 million), but net profit remained static at around £10.3 million due to recent investment in production facilities.[9] In June 2009 Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham, the former Minister of State for Trade, become chairman of Triumph motorcycles (Hinckley) Ltd and the 1,600 cc (98 cu in) Thunderbird twin-cylinder cruiser was announced.[10]

The Group turnover increased by 11% from £312.4 million in 2010 to £345.3 million in 2011 and unit sales of motorcycles increased by 7% from 45,501 to 48,684. This increase in unit sales can be largely attributed to the introduction of incremental models to the range. The operating profit before interest and tax grew from £15.1 million to £22.3 million due to strong sales of motorcycles and related products, benefiting from improved use of working capital and continued focus upon the cost base. During 2011 Triumph launched three new motorcycles: the Tiger Explorer, Speed Triple R and the Steve McQueen Special,[11] successfully bucking the trend of the global downturn in motorcycle sales

Through the Fifties and Sixties, names such as Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando cemented the Triumph legend, while numerous land speed records and race track successes gave bikes like the Thunderbird, Bonneville, Tiger and Trident iconic status."

"At Tomorrow’s Journey we have developed a platform called JRNY which will solve the chronic underutilisation of assets, epitomised by the fact that cars in private ownership spend 95% of the time parked*. Even new mobility models such as the world’s largest car sharing scheme has a utilisation rate of less than 40%**. The JRNY platform is the key to increasing utilisation across all services, which has numerous benefits for multiple stakeholders.

JRNY achieves this by facilitating a service agnostic approach to asset management which we call the shared neutral fleet. To achieve this our platform enables fleet owners to contribute their underutilised vehicle assets to the network and set criteria for its usage. The system then matches that asset to unmet demand from network users offering mobility services such as car sharing. Ultimately this means less assets that are more fully utilised, which is more efficient for all and maximises the benefits of new mobility for people, communities, businesses and the planet.

"We make software for drones, to use them for surveillance, infrastructure surveying, farming, delivery, and similar purposes. We make both the UI and the AI (computer vision and navigation). 

We started the company because we believe in helping and advancing humanity with robots, and we want to start and be at the center of that revolution. At ADIA Robotics, we are passionate about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. 

We make software and physical accessories that integrate with existing drones (DJI, Parrot, 3DR) to solve business problems. Some businesses are buying drones and hiring pilots to fly them, and other companies have gone so far as to process the video stream afterwards, to gather data. A few companies have added basic autonomy through GPS waypoints and automatic charging. We’re taking things to the next step, with computer-vision-based autonomy, remote control over the internet, and more friendly UIs, to make products that are as easy to use as Word, web apps, and phone apps.

Our focus is integral, helping businesses in terms of strategy, technology, and design; including tweaking usability and training staff. We are looking to use local partners to outsource the more logistic tasks, and focus on design & tech.

Currently, ADIA Robotics is the first to market in control over the internet of commercially available drones. We’ve released an app that integrates with the largest manufacturer of drones (DJI) and helps people coordinate flights with pilots in more than one location around the World. In other words, pilots can control many drones at once over the internet, and we can easily switch control from outsourced pilots anywhere in the world, to Artificial Intelligence, or to users/customers.

At our company, we have been developing two new technologies that will change the game: real-time cloud-based computer vision based on drones and swarming, and collaboration + coordination of multiple drones in real time. 

By combining these two technologies, ADIA Robotics is uniquely positioned to tackle the current business needs for drones, as well as innovate in ways to use drones tomorrow.

All the products on offer are rated by the Bike Light Shop – but nothing scores less than 6/10 because otherwise they wouldn’t stock it!

The site also includes a glossary aimed at helping users understand the terminology of bike light manufacturers e.g. how to determine how bright lights really are when manufacturers use different terms – Lux, Lumens, Watts, Candelas etc. Users are also asked to send in further information to the glossary section which could help others.

The creators of the site felt that there was little real help for cyclists in the area of bike lights and that most online retailers simply hosted/sold the products and left people to make their own decisions based on price alone.

The Bike Light Shop was founded in the summer of 2010 by Simon Bever, a 47 year old marketer with 25 years of experience of online and offline marketing; a lifelong cyclist with tens of thousands of miles of touring, commuting and racing under his belt.

"SUMMERHILL HAS A TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS POWDER BIOFEUL TO ACT LIKE A GAS
A burner system and biofuel refinement method that fits into our target audience operations as a retrofit with ann outcome of a 30-50% savings in operational heating costs, and a new revenue stream for the customer’s own client chain. 
The result is easy, low cost adoption, and a “perpetual” revenue model based on usage fee for Summerhill. 

This also solves the “bulk” of biomass problem and associated transportation issues
Summerhill possesses the key to the symbiotic relationship between a deep understanding of the agricultural market and economic viability of powdered fuels in the biomass market.

Safe and reliable. Waste and byproducts derived from materials such as Alfalfa, Cane, Citrus, Corn, Flax, Manure, Sewage, Sorghum, Switchgrass, and Wood can be leveraged to create storable fuel and energy. Powdered biomass can enhance efficiency of cellulose to ethanol and diodigester processes by using byproduct for heat recovery in operations. Further, it is well documented across many industries to be easily and safely transported.
Efficiency: Summerhill methods recover high percentages of energy stored in biomass without use of complex fermentation processes, fertilizer, food crops, or cultivated land. 
The Summerhill process is easily inserted in the farm/processor/storage hub model that is inherent to agriculture. While most economic commercialization timelines for cleantech and green technology are expected to be 15-20 years, investors, the U.S. government  and affiliates would like to see a reduced timeline of to three to five years.  Since Summerhill leverages existing assets and ways of doing business, the company is confident it can achieve commercialization with an attractive ROI on a three to five year schedule. 

Summerhill’s strategy is to focus its suite of solutions at each point in a mapped ecosystem, and integrate at every point of the supply chain via licensing, royalti"

"Quickly create private communities of customers, riders or drivers of your choosing and start offering rides.

With RideConnect, you can schedule your rides, or order a car from a simple interface.

RideConnect is a ridesharing platform. Casual and commercial drivers can offer transportation directly to their riders through RideConnect, thereby keeping what money they make.

With RideConnect, people in cities, towns or any other type of community can organize their own rideshare even where other car service options don't exist.

Features

RideBoard

A centralized scheduler for rides. Riders can schedule their rides with their preferred drivers up to 24 hrs in advance. Drivers can announce their trips so that riders can ask for a ride.

My Community

A dynamic list of riders and drivers sourced from your private contacts. You control who's in and who's out. You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community.

RideMode

See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie.

Best Practices

Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook. You can also block people within the My Community screen in RideConnect and this will prevent them from sharing rides with you but will not remove them from your community. Be safe. Drive safe. Ride safe.


That's it. Start sharing rides."

"LogistiVIEW's Connected Worker Platform combines augmented reality, computer vision, and artificial intelligence on industrial mobile computers and smart glasses to improve the productivity and job satisfaction of workers in logistics.  Labor is the second most expensive part of the greater than $1T logistics market (behind fuel) and billions of dollars are lost annually to labor shortages, inefficiency, errors, training, and turnover.  By enabling workers with intuitive AR instructions, key task information, and AI-driven workflow, workers are faster, smarter, safer, and more accurate.  When workers are connected to devices around them such as carts, shelves, conveyors, and autonomous robots, LogistiVIEW creates flexible automation that replaces expensive fixed-automation with AR-rendered, software-defined automation that is both faster and less expensive to install and change than traditional fixed automation.

Luggage Forward has since grown to become the leading provider of door-to-door luggage and sports equipment delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.  

Offering a range of specialized options allowing clients the convenience of traveling without their bags, Luggage Forward has multiple services and price points to fit the requirements of almost any itinerary. 

The company has pioneered a straightforward process of forwarding luggage by leveraging proprietary technology as well as trusted relationships with a comprehensive network of agents and shippers, resulting in unparalleled reliability. Luggage Forward’s industry-leading set of online tools allows clients to generate pricing, securely book online and track luggage real-time. 

Powered by the proprietary Automated Routing Control™ system, the Luggage Forward website is able to instantly identify the most reliable, convenient and cost-effective method of shipment for each individual booking.

Beginning in 2009, Luggage Forward embarked on a strategy of consolidation of the then-fragmented luggage shipping industry. Ultimately, seven different brands have been acquired so far. The combined industry experience of these companies approaches 50 years. These additions have fortified Luggage Forward’s leadership position in the fast growing luggage delivery market."

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.  

Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.

"NASA's vision is to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years.

President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge.

Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites.

After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations.

NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner.

Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth."

In response, the inhabitants of Yakutsk made the ""Independent Drivers"" group on a social network, where people could post a request for a ride and put the price they are willing to pay, and then drivers took such orders. Soon after, the group was replaced by a stand-alone mobile application, called inDriver, which was based on the concept of the real-time deals (RTD). Today inDriver's user base exceeds more than 50 million users in over 300 cities in 31 countries all over the world.

Since 2012, inDriver has been implementing the BeginIT social education project aimed at identifying and providing career guidance in the field of new technologies to talented children from orphanages, boarding and rural schools.

In that time, our technology-powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers.

In August 2014, Taxi Magic became a Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere. All rides begin and end at the curb, and our technology improves the entire experience from curb to curb by eradicating underlying pain points and making ground travel seamless and hassle-free.

"Connected Signals, Inc. is an innovative startup in the connected car space that delivers real-time, predictive traffic signal data. Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights.

Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light.

They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format."

"The BART story began in 1946. It began not by governmental fiat, but as a concept gradually evolving at informal gatherings of business and civic leaders on both sides of the San Francisco Bay. Facing a heavy post-war migration to the area and its consequent automobile boom, these people discussed ways of easing the mounting congestion that was clogging the bridges spanning the Bay. In 1947, a joint Army-Navy review Board concluded that another connecting link between San Francisco and Oakland would be needed in the years ahead to prevent intolerable congestion on the Bay Bridge. The link? An underwater tube devoted exclusively to high-speed electric trains.

Since 1911, visionaries had periodically brought up this Jules Verne concept. But now, pressure for a traffic solution increased with the population. In 1951, the State Legislature created the 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay. The Commission's charge was to study the Bay Area's long range transportation needs in the context of environmental problems and then recommend the best solution."

"Let me share with you a well-kept secret: FedEx does not own the FedEx truck that delivers packages to your home.  Here is another one: FedEx does not employ the driver of that truck.  FedEx subcontracts with companies like ours to deliver packages to people’s homes.

We have two main ways to expand our business and increase our revenue – maintaining an excellent record of timely and safe delivery of packages and acquiring additional routes.  In our business, we are rated by FedEx on our ability to deliver packages in a timely, effective and safe manner.  If we are successful in doing so, we will be eligible for certain monthly and quarterly bonuses.  In the aggregate, those bonuses can be significant.  In addition, maintaining a timely, effective and safe delivery record puts us in a position to acquire additional delivery routes, if and when they become available.

"The Seawind aircraft is a perfect union of form and function.  The aerodynamic sleek flowing lines make it the most striking of land or sea planes.  We have developed the world’s best and fastest 4/5 place amphibian.

The spacious cabin, panoramic view, quiet environment, and form-fitting seats all combine to create total traveling comfort. 

Since the dawn of aviation, designers have been trying to create a seaplane that would fly as fast and as far as a land plane and carry a reasonable useful load over a long distance. 
Using advanced composite technology and innovative design, Seawind has accomplished that lofty goal.

High speed stability is superb.  The standard slotted flaps and the swept back wingtip floats (sponsons) create an extraordinary ground effect, cushions the touchdown, and speeds the lift-off on water and land.  Low speed stability is excellent. 

Never before has an amphibian offered so much comfort.  The Seawind has the widest cabin in its class, with the standard executive deluxe four-place configuration or the optional family five-place seating.  The seats are bucket-style adjustable with temper foam for ultimate comfort.  The special designed seats have passed the stringent 26g forward and 19g - 60°up vertical crash tests.

The wrap-around windshield offers a spectacular panoramic view even for the aft seats.
Whether the mission is a business meeting in the city or a fishing trip into the wilderness, or cross country travel, the Seawind fills the bill.  The Seawind is the only plane that fulfills every customer’s needs."

"StreetGreen – A new OOH Marketing Channel and Advertising Technology

WHAT:
An incredibly powerful technology stack that, when combined with a new, transportation law, creates a dynamic and trackable out-of-home advertising channel called “Trailerskirt Advertising”.

The “President’s Climate Action Plan” requires all that all “18-wheelers” become 20% more fuel-efficient.  To comply, most fleets will install hard-polymer aerodynamic side skirts. There are 40,000,000+ trucks on the road in America. 

Over 1,000,000 trucks already have sideskirt panels installed, and we can map their routes to your retail locations – resulting in an extremely dynamic, attractive, effective OOH advertising channel with trackable impression data.

Trailerskirt Ads dramatically lowers CPM while providing more impressions, dwell-time and reach than traditional bulletins.

StreetGreen’s advertising technology combines Fleet ELD, GIS mapping, retail GPS, fresh census data to overlay store locations, dedicated fleet routes, mobile traffic, foot traffic, vehicle traffic, and drive a fleet of highly visible mobile billboards past the stores on those routes. The dashboard, built specifically for the F500 CMO, displays:
•	# of stores along route
•	Total Cost per store/per campaign (the amount HQ bills franchisee)
o	Avg. ROI per store/per campaign (amount store makes after they pay HQ)	
•	Total Impressions	
o	Census	 (w/in .25mi geofence)
•	CPM	
o	Mobile (w/in .25mi geofence)
•	CPM	
•	Total number of Drive-Bys (per campaign)

•	Total miles

"Scan Man Auto Diagnostics  is in a category that would be best described as  ""micro"" currently. Currently there are  less than 5 companies doing what they do with multiple vans on the road in the entire country and he believes they are in the best market.They have been in business for almost 5 years. My revenue grows close to 50% year over year. Revenue growth has slowed as they need to expand to keep up with demand.  They have exhausted their cash expanding last year. One of the ways that car manufacturers ""fix"" their problems in cars today is with software updates. The equipment to properly diagnose and update today's cars is  prohibitively expensive to the vast majority of repair shops. They have the tools to provide those services to individual shops and dealers for most makes and model 1996 and newer. Their business in in the Washington DC suburbs and the growth potential is phenomenal not including the name, logo, and business possibly ripe for franchising. I have neither the experience or capital to consider that at this moment and would consider most opportunities.  They have many shops, an example would be similar to Carmax. They have many cars a day they send to the dealer to get diagnosed. They are limited to what they can do in a parking lot out of a van and are looking to open a fixed location repair shop that would do the same thing Scan Man presently does with the addition of complete auto repair. Scan Man is my second successful business start up and the other was a repair shop. I personally consider success extremely likely in this market.

 The Company aims to purchase pre-owned yachts and upgrade the yachts to today’s highest quality standards, including the latest technology, amenities, accommodations and entertainment. The advantage of this is that the yachts have already been built and can be put into the program immediately. The shares will be broken down by weeks, with the Broward yachts having 36 weeks available. 

 The first two Benetti yachts have 34 shares available and the other three have 40 shares available. Meisler Yachts has also a new building program planned, which is to build three “Meisler Crown Princess”, 301 feet (92 m) Super Luxury Motor Yachts for delivery in 2019 and 2020.

"Raspberry Express is an express carpooling service provider.

Raspberry Express is the world leader in development of express carpooling systems.  In addition to providing express carpooling services, Raspberry Express can assist with the analysis and marketing necessary for establishing express carpooling routes.

Express carpooling is meeting-place based carpooling, in which participants make their way (walk, cycle, scooter, drive) to a meeting-place, and form fuller cars in the order of their arrival.  Each meeting-place is specific to one destination.  There are three types of participants:  those who always want to drive; those who always want to ride; and those who will do whichever works best for them on the day.  There is no trip-by-trip pre-arrangement of who will ride with whom.  The return journey might be by similar express carpool, or by public transport.  Three and four-person carpools are as easy to form as two-person ones.  Participants can make their final decision to ride or drive right up until the last moment.

Express carpooling is best understood by reference to the 'slug lines' in Washington DC, and the 'casual carpooling' in San Francisco.  These systems developed organically over many years.

Raspberry Express seeks to catalyse new express carpooling routes and so achieve the benefit of this approach to carpool formation for additional cities."

"DAP’s history takes us back to the early ‘80s when Domingo Andrés Pivcevic –son of settlers who arrived in Magallanes in 1900- decided to purchase an airplane to cover his needs of transporting goods, due to the scarce land or air connections that existed in Magallanes at the time.With vision, he saw a business opportunity and a way to help the community by connecting the Magallanes Region and its people with the rest of the country. Thus, in 1980 Aerovías DAP is born, becoming “The airline of Patagonia” and to this day, connecting the Magallanes Region with scheduled flights, operating from Monday to Saturday from Punta Arenas to Puerto Williams and Porvenir.
In the late ‘80s the company grew, incorporating itself to the touristic boom that these beautiful lands at the end of the world were experiencing, with the creation of travel agency DAP Antártica (1989), tour operator whose mission is to offer an unforgettable adventure and top-level service to its clients.In February of that same year, DAP achieved its first flight to the White Continent, building with time a route that has gained more and more relevancy, with transport and logistic support for a number of scientific missions from all over the world, as well as exclusive tour programs in King George Island, Antarctica.
In 1989 DAP Helicópteros is created as well; helicopter division born with the purpose of satisfying the needs of the National Petroleum Company of Chile (ENAP – Magallanes), in regards to incorporating the use of these type of aircraft to its Off-Shore operations, located in the eastern entrance of the Magallanes Strait.
With an impeccable operation through the years, in 1996 DAP starts carrying out Off-Shore flights in Argentina for SIPETROL, international subsidiary to ENAP in this country. Eventually, in 2002 it based one of its AS 355 F2 helicopters permanently at the BRM base located near Faro Vírgenes, eastern entrance of the Magallanes Strait. This way, DAP Helicópteros Argentina is born, a legally constituted company with Argentinean staff.Today, DAP Helicópteros holds an impressive record of over 100.000 flight hours and almost 30 years in the most demanding of conditions.
In 2004, and thanks to the incorporation of new helicopters, DAP starts to build a network of air medical rescue services across the country, creating AeroRescate S.A., which today has bases in Antofagasta, Región Metropolitana, Punta Arenas and Antarctica.
Being from its beginnings a company dedicated to market niches, in 2012 DAP starts carrying out flights for the mining industry in the North of Chile. Operating under the Mineral Airways badge, and with a fleet that expands to count with BAe/Avro R85 and Boeing 737-200Adv units in the present, the company transports mining workers directly from the city of Santiago to their work locations, drastically shortening the travel times. Furthermore, with this fleet of jet planes, the company expands its network of tourist and business charter flights in the whole country, and to different points of the continent.
In 2017 Betanzos ship is incorporated into the fleet, a versatile vessel that multiplies DAP’s logistic capabilities at the southern end of the world, to give solution to the complex needs of scientific missions, as well as making the company’s activities in Antarctica more and more self-sustained.With strong roots in Magallanes, and a staff of experienced pilots and highly trained technical personnel, prepared to operate a fleet of airplanes and helicopters carefully chosen to fly in the highest standards of safety and efficiency, DAP continues to build its history, flight after flight."

"The Problem: Most of the bus companies are badly referenced on Google. Moreover, those companies do not offer online payment. It exists the phone booking but calling centers do not answer or the line is busy. The last solution to buy a bus ticket is to go to the terminal but all the companies have their own bus terminal. There is no online platform that concentrates the bus company offers and information such as bus services, or different prices. 

The Solution: We offer two solutions: a BtoC and a BtoBtoC system. The BtoC is the busportal.pe website where customers can compare all the companies integrated on the website and buy their bus tickets online. The BtoBtoC solution is a integrated selling platform on the bus websites to manage their billing process online.

Competitive Advantage: First mover Advantage in the Peruvian market. We have two weapons: the mobile application will be automatically install on Movistar's mobile phone in every country we are going as we have the exclusivity with Movistar and Telefonica. Moreover we have signed some agreements with the Peruvian government to let them use our widget on the Peruvian official websites. the widget is a access to the Busportal database with the design of the website where the widget is implemented.

The Revenue Model: We have various mechanisms to generate revenue. The main mechanism is the commission both BtoC and BtoBtoC paid by the bus companies on each bus ticket we sell. We do not charge the customer for our fee. We also generate selling reports for the bus companies to improve efficiency. We are developing additional mechanisms such the fee on a disbursement, ads on the website. As we have a positive and consequent treasury (we pay our suppliers 20 days after) we can generate financial revenues."
