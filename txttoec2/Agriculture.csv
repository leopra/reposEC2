For 2014 the journey continues to grow and evolve, with some new stage developments that are sure to blow minds.

Indeed in a changing market environment for field seeds, Biogemma's 5 shareholders seek to evolve their model of cooperation.

The project should be implemented by the end of the year, provided that all social and legal procedures are completed by then.

With regards to oilseeds, which represent a strong, shared interest for the shareholders involved, the project will update the model of cooperation by creating a shared structure, financed by the 3 seed companies (Euralis Semences, Limagrain, and RAGT Semences) and Sofiprotéol. The research activities would continue to be run from the current Biogemma site in Mondonville, France (31). This new company would place the shareholders in a position to pursue ambitious research targeting a dynamic European oilseed rape and sunflower market, and open up new prospects for seed creation in response to agriculture's major challenges.

For cereals (maize and wheat), the project would result in the integration of Biogemma's cereal research into Limagrain – based on Chappe Research Center, France (63) – which would provide it with a cereal biotechnology organization in line with its goals.

With the separation of Biogemma’s activities, the facilities in Paris would be reassessed. The Paris headquarter staff would be proposed to be transferred to Chappes to bring all the teams together in Auvergne.

The project would protect jobs, maintain current skills within Biogemma, and further all current collaborative projects with third parties."

We have infrastructures that are based in the latest technologies as also a highly qualified team, with the aim of creating products of the highest guarantee requested by our customers.

Our farm is strategically located in Salamanca, always ensuring a pleasant well-being to the animal.

INNOVATION: WHAT WE DO?

MealFood Europe works to introduce new species in the food and feed markets, working with only one kind of insect, Tenebrio Molitor.

The current status of the animal feed, especially in such important sectors as aquaculture, pork or poultry, presents serious problems related to obtaining the necessary proteins to supply these livestock species.

In fact, the current deficit of protein production involves an upward trend in the prices that are causing difficulties for certain sectors and/or producers. In this area, our proposal is simple, using the Tenebrio Molitor products as a basis and/or complement to achieve healthy nutrition.

SOSTENIBILITY: WHY WE DO IT?

The use of insects in the food and feed industry involves a good number of environmental, health and social life benefits.

- Insects are very efficient in the rates of food-meat; on average, insects can convert 2 kg of food in 1 kg mass of insect, while livestock requires 8 kg of feed to produce   
 1 kg of meat.
- Greenhouse gases produced by most of the insects are lower than conventional livestock. Pigs, for example, produce between 10 and 100 times more greenhouse gases per kilogram than the Mealworms.
- Insects can be feeding with nutrients that are not being used usually, turning them into high quality protein.
- Insects use less water than traditional livestock. Tenebrio Molitor, for example, is more resistant to droughts than traditional livestocks.
- The insect breeding needs less ground that the conventional livestock activity."

"Simris is a multi-awarded pioneering agribusiness growing algae in Sweden. We save and protect endangered marine habitats, by producing unique ingredients from farmed microalgae instead of fish and other marine animals. Our goal is to be the beacon for positive change in business. We are based in Hammenhög, Österlen/greater Copenhagen, close to the sun and the sea.

Simris is a pioneer in the development of microalgae as a novel crop and biotechnological production platform. We have developed an industrial process for growing microalgae to produce omega-3, as a vegan and superior alternative to fish oil and krill. We own the entire value chain from farm to bottle, i.e. from cultivation to finished product. We have recently started to develop further substances and ingredients from microalgae, to replace additional commodities from endangered marine species and ocean habitats at risk.

Microalgae, or phytoplankton, are microscopically small aquatic plants. Just as land-based plants, microalgae grow by photosynthesis, where atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted to oxygen with the help of sunlight. Microalgae constitute the basis of the marine food chain, meaning that many nutrients that are crucial for human and animal health ultimately originate from microalgae. These substances eventually accumulate in higher marine organisms such as fish and seafood through the marine food chain. Many of these marine species are under the threat of extinction, due to overfishing and the destruction of marine habitats. Furthermore, marine commodities often contain high levels of mercury, PCB, PFAS and dioxins, due to toxic pollutants and plastics in the oceans. By sourcing marine commodities directly from microalgae instead of via fish or krill, we obtain better alternatives that are entirely plant-based and without the environmental toxins. In this way, the products are both safer for consumers, but also superior in terms of positive environmental impact.

Cultivation of microalgae is a relatively novel technology at the intersection between biotechnology and precision aquaculture. The commercial potential is considered vast in a number of industries including food, pharma, skincare and advanced materials. However, commercial applications for modern microalgae technology are still limited, as most technology is yet at research stage or restricted to smaller development companies. Simris is one of the leading companies in the field and one of few companies globally that have succeeded to prove their technology at industrial scale and reached market phase for its products.

Contrary to industry standard which uses yeast-like algae grown in closed tanks on sugar substrate, Simris uses photosynthetic algae for the production of omega-3. This process has positive climate effects through the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Also, Simris exclusively grows natural algae strains without genetic modifications that are common in conventional bioprocess engineering.

Our first products are sold under the proprietary Simris® Algae Omega-3 consumer brand, targeted at the globally growing markets for wellness products and plant-based alternatives. The products are currently launched on the US market, including trendsetting retailers such as Goop and Erewhon Market. We also have a distribution agreement in South Korea, and retail agreements with Sweden’s major department store A°hle´ns and largest pharmacy chain Apoteket.

Simris was one of the first publicly listed vegan companies, and has been listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market since 2016. We are still in development phase and aim to create long-term sustainable profit for our shareholders, in harmony with our society, our environment and the climate."

"KisanHub is a Crop Intelligence Platform and was borne out of a desire to give farmers everywhere a sophisticated, meaningful yet, simple decision-support. The platform connects enterprises with their growers to provide crop intelligence through crop specific apps and is focussed on in-season agronomy advice on pest/diseases, fertiliser application, irrigation management and yield prediction to reduce the input costs and improve profit margins. These insights are provided to farmers and their enterprises by assimilating and aggregating disparate datasets. The suite of applications fit around the enterprise’s needs, with the key operational and agronomic data being seamlessly shared throughout the platform. The aim of KisanHub is to connect agriculture for the benefit of farmers globally to help them grow more and use less.

KisanHub’s core technology brings together public and private data and the platform is built to connect farmers with the rest of the supply chain. This connectivity is achieved through the collaboration tools provided on the platform. This in turn empowers all the market participants to communicate with farmers for in-season operational, agronomic or business advisory services. The aggregated data on crops provide supply chain visibility to enterprises where such contractual relations with farmers exist. The platform provides advisory on pest/diseases, fertiliser application, irrigation management and yield prediction so farmers can apply right input of a right product at the right time and in the right quantity."
"The Small Robot Company is a start up that focuses on revolutionizing the way that technology is used to create food. Ben Scott-Robinson, an experienced entrepreneur working at the cutting edge of user centred design and Sam Watson Jones, a fourth generation farmer, were inspired by the work of Simon Blackmore in the National Centre for Precision Farming at Harper Adams and his vision for replacing much of the work done by tractors in fields with a series of highly accurate, smart, lightweight robots. Sam's first step was to interview a large number of farmers around the country, firstly on the pain points around their current, tractor centred systems and secondly on what specific outcomes they would look for from a new model of farming. His discovery was that farmers felt poorly served by existing machinery manufacturers and new technology delivered as either hardware or software products.

The company's vision is to automate arable crop farming. The small robots Tom, Dick, and Harry will care for each plant in the crop on an individual basis. It will only feed and spray the plants that need it, with no waste. Per plant precision, not blanket chemical spraying. The Small Robot Company was founded on 2017 and is headquartered in Portsmouth, England."

"Wynnstay was founded in 1917 by tenant farmers of the local Wynnstay estate and was formally constituted as a farmers'? co operative shortly afterwards. Over the succeeding decades, the organisation steadily grew.

A series of acquisitions during the last 15 years has expanded Wynnstay's trading area to primarily include all of Wales, the North West, Yorkshire and most of the Midlands.

Through our history of utilising franchise manufacturers for many of our products, customers are serviced as far a field as Somerset, Sussex and Hampshire.

How We Are Growing:

In 1992, Wynnstay converted from a co-operative to a Public Limited Company in order to secure the company's long-term future enabling the business to access alternative sources of capital for long-term investment.

More recently, in 2004, the Group floated on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange where shares can be traded easily and company performance monitored by investors.

Despite this change of status, Wynnstay is still farmer controlled; over 50% of the company's shareholders are local farmers, the remaining being outside investors and staff, all of whom own shares."

"The first boxes of fruit and vegetables delivered from myfarmfreshbox were dispatched in September 2016. Since that first delivery the growth of the company has led to a move from the garden to the 30,000 sq.ft. warehouse in Maidenhead, out of which the company operates today. When it started out myfarmfreshbox was a one-man operation delivering ten boxes of fruit and vegetables a week. Today the company has fourteen employees and delivers some 750 boxes weekly, adding up to an impressive total of 40,000 boxes of fresh produce delivered annually. As well as growing in size, myfarmfreshbox has also diversified its offering, and in addition to the traditional fruit and vegetables that it offered at the outset, the company now offers home-made soups and pies, dairy products, bread, fruit juices, cakes, and free range eggs and meat, the latter delivered in special chilled packaging to ensure that it keeps chilled and fresh. Myfarmfreshbox is committed to providing its customers with a broad range of fresh, quality produce at good value for their money and with a reasonable shelf life.
Myfarmfreshbox services a catchment area that extends from London to Maidenhead, and includes several points in between. Deliveries are made overnight, with a guarantee of the boxes arriving by 4 a.m., meaning that people who are out at work all day can bring the fresh produce in before leaving in the morning or setting off on car pools to school, and come home to a kitchen well-stocked with fresh produce, all without having to actually go to the shops. The downside of this overnight delivery is that people is blocks of flats with security doors may not be able to enjoy the service if the company cannot access the building during the night.
The fruit and vegetables offered by myfarmfreshbox.co.uk are locally grown, fresh produce, but not organic, although general local farmers do tend to keep their use of chemicals down to a minimum. This preference for local fresh over organic stems from a number of basic reasons – the desire to create sustainable, local agriculture; organic produce is often not available locally and is brought in from further away, meaning may “food miles” are traveled and the produce is less fresh; costs are reduced as the middleman is eliminated when myfarmfreshbox buys directly from the local farmers, and this cost reduction is passed on to the customers. 
Becoming a myfarmfreshbox.co.uk customer is quick and simple, and is done online on the company’s attractive, user-friendly site. The first step is entering your postcode to see what can be delivered to your area, and unchecking produce that you do not want to receive. On this page the customer can also add eggs for weekly or fortnightly delivery, as well as potatoes for monthly delivery. The next steps allow the customer to select from the range of additional products offered by myfarmfreshbox. After selection of all products, the customer is required to enter the delivery address and pay the £2 delivery charge using the company’s secure server."

"In a nutshell? We develop and produce cottonised SeFF Hemp. But that’s not quite the whole story. Actually, it’s far from it. You see what we do, is driven by grave ecological problems – out on the catwalk, and on the shelves of stores in multiple industries.

Apparel, textiles, non-wovens – man made fibres and cotton – they’re water and chemical-thirsty, their manufacturing is seriously energy intensive. We think that there’s a better way. Actually, we don’t like to boast, but we know that there’s a better way.

Change is on the horizon. And we're already ahead of the curve.

SeFF is created through cutting-edge processes that unleash the strength, versatility and multi-market desirability of Hemp as a material – wispy-soft, wholly-durable and environmentally-friendly.

Alongside companies such as ABB, we’ve created and developed a patented, planet-loving technology to fully and finally realise the potential of bast fibres such as hemp. Now, our ‘where next’ is moving to market – introducing a truly disruptive technology that will go far beyond the usual low value markets hemp fibres are currently used for, and instead be able to impact the fashion, industrial, textile, energy, medical, agricultural and composite material industries too.

Founded in the UK in 2017, SeFF is making a name for itself – one influenced by our rich heritage and pretty talented team. Together, we’ve been processing natural fibres for four generations – passing our knowledge onwards and always moving with the times. Our leadership has owned, operated and successfully sold manufacturing facilities around the world.

By being strategy-smart, partner-savvy and freethinking when it comes to the technologies we employ, we’re growing, quickly. From field to finished product we’re spinning a new yarn with a history that entwines every aspect of bast fibres.

We’re hedging our bets on nothing less than a textile revolution. Let’s face it, it’s so sorely required and yet so drastically unrealised."

"Nemgenix is an international agricultural biotechnology company developing new technologies for the control of plant parasitic nematodes and aphids.

The company was founded by Sean Hird and Mike Jones in 2007 with the aim to innovate in the field of nematode and aphid control.

Both nematodes and aphids are significant pests of the world’s major crops against which there is limited natural resistance. In particular, plant parasitic nematodes are devastating root pathogens causing global losses of US$125bn+ pa. These small thread-like worms are endemic in all soil types and reduce yields through impaired water and nutrient uptake and increased susceptibility to other root pathogens. Likewise, losses from aphids are also very high due to the physical damage they cause and their role as a vector for plant viruses and other invasive organisms. It is estimated that aphids are the primary vector for 50% of all known plant viruses.

Building on the expertise and experience of Mike Jones, an internationally regarded expert in the field of plant nematology and virology, Nemgenix has focussed on the development of novel RNAi-based crop traits to confer nematode and aphid resistance. RNA interference (‘RNAi’) is an endogenous gene silencing mechanism found in plants and other organisms which can be exploited through the design of biotech traits. Nemgenix has successfully shown proof-of-concept of its utility in a range of plant species. This work has led to a number of patent filings which are now being prosecuted in all major territories.

Nemgenix is currently working with several corporate partners to progress its RNAi-based nematode control traits with field trials anticipated in 2014. Nemgenix is constructing specially designed field trial plots where nematode populations can be manipulated and soil conditions modelled, to reflect field conditions in a range of key growing areas.

In 2012 Nemgenix’s Crop Protection Unit was formed to undertake the development of an integrated in silico pesticide discovery platform known as ‘i-QUEST™’. This will combine with the company’s bioassay systems and field trial resources to provide a ‘screen to field’ pesticide development capability. In the case of nematodes, the use of chemical controls is often limited by environmental legislation and cost which has resulted in increased demand for new nematicides. The i-QUEST™ platform is currently being used to exploit this opportunity.

Nemgenix has research and development facilities in Perth, Australia at the Western Australia State Agricultural Biotechnology Centre and also in Harpenden, UK. Nemgenix has a team of 10 full-time researchers.

The company secured seed investment in 2008 from Stone Ridge Ventures, an Australian venture capital firm, and has been awarded numerous government grants."

"The success of your business really comes down to your company’s ability to consistently hire the top performing leadership talent and cascade this success down through your teams and across all business functions. Therefore your ability to get access to the top C-Suite, VPs & Directors is fundamental to your long-term success.

Ensuring mis-hires don’t occur is also imperative to your success, as this can have a detrimental effect on your business performance, the morale of your teams, let alone an issue that takes you away from your focus on your business growth.

How many mis-hires have you had and what impact has it had on your business success?

That’s Where I Come In & What I can Help You With
You see, the demand for top talent is fierce, particularly for high performing leaders. These C-Suite, VP & Director level Candidates are not perusing job-boards, they don’t know you and are inundated with poor approaches by numerous recruiters.

Standard, inefficient executive search methods are failing you and don’t give you access to the vast majority of the senior & executive candidate marketplace.

Does This Sound Familiar?
Internal Recruitment Team / External Recruitment & Search suppliers are only able to deliver ‘low hanging fruit’ – candidates easily accessible/active in the market.
You haven’t had access to Top Executive candidates with the required Curiosity, Passion & Drive to uncover business opportunity, drive sales and limit wasted resources.
You’re not getting your message known to A-Player candidates in the market, that you are recruiting for a senior role.
Prospective Candidates don’t know you or your company brand.
You don’t know where to look to get full exposure to all relevant Executive Talent. You know that they are out there, but where exactly!
You don’t have the time to look or it takes too long to fill critical CxO, VP or Director level vacancies
How Have We Achieved Our Solution?
We’ve spent years, nurturing and engaging top talent to be able to reach them when our clients have a recruitment need. This allows us to have a strong inbound pull of top talent and NOT just the outbound reach of other executive search firms.

Do you want to settle for only the active candidate reach which accounts for around 13% of the executive market, or would you like to reach the remaining 87% of passive talent in your skill requirements?

Why Partner with Aruba Exec?
Our service is high touch throughout & personal relationship driven and has many of our candidates becoming recruiting clients. We’re routinely told, that our personal service & results far exceeds the large, big brand executive search firms, who are quite often restricted by many ‘hands-off’ restrictions on where they can search. Clients come to us because of our process, our methodology & our ETAR System giving clients access to candidates they wouldn’t have had access to via traditional executive search."
"We make software for drones, to use them for surveillance, infrastructure surveying, farming, delivery, and similar purposes. We make both the UI and the AI (computer vision and navigation). 

We started the company because we believe in helping and advancing humanity with robots, and we want to start and be at the center of that revolution. At ADIA Robotics, we are passionate about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. 

We make software and physical accessories that integrate with existing drones (DJI, Parrot, 3DR) to solve business problems. Some businesses are buying drones and hiring pilots to fly them, and other companies have gone so far as to process the video stream afterwards, to gather data. A few companies have added basic autonomy through GPS waypoints and automatic charging. We’re taking things to the next step, with computer-vision-based autonomy, remote control over the internet, and more friendly UIs, to make products that are as easy to use as Word, web apps, and phone apps.

Our focus is integral, helping businesses in terms of strategy, technology, and design; including tweaking usability and training staff. We are looking to use local partners to outsource the more logistic tasks, and focus on design & tech.

Currently, ADIA Robotics is the first to market in control over the internet of commercially available drones. We’ve released an app that integrates with the largest manufacturer of drones (DJI) and helps people coordinate flights with pilots in more than one location around the World. In other words, pilots can control many drones at once over the internet, and we can easily switch control from outsourced pilots anywhere in the world, to Artificial Intelligence, or to users/customers.

At our company, we have been developing two new technologies that will change the game: real-time cloud-based computer vision based on drones and swarming, and collaboration + coordination of multiple drones in real time. 

By combining these two technologies, ADIA Robotics is uniquely positioned to tackle the current business needs for drones, as well as innovate in ways to use drones tomorrow.

"Oberon Fuels is bringing DME to North America with its proprietary skid-mounted, modular, small-scale process. The Oberon production units use various feedstocks—such as biogas (animal and food waste, wastewater treatment, landfills), natural gas, and stranded gas—and they produce 3,000–10,000 gallons of DME per day. The Oberon process cost-effectively converts methane to DME, resulting in stable pricing (not dependent on crude oil), at a price that is competitive with diesel. The modular design can be deployed to remote stranded-gas locations that can be difficult and expensive to harvest, and to industrial operations where our units can monetize waste CO2 streams.

These small-scale Oberon production units enable the development of regional fuel markets that service local customers engaged in regional haul, so initially we bypass the need for a national infrastructure.  In addition, capital expenditures are in sync with market growth. As the DME market develops, more small-scale production units will be deployed in each region and new regions will be added across North America.

While DME has been in development for several decades, market forces such as increasing emission regulations, the spread between natural gas and crude oil pricing, and innovations in processing technology make now an exciting time to commercialize DME particularly in the heavy-duty trucking sector.

"Fruitspot is fastest platform to trade fresh products.

It's not uncommon for fruit/veg growers to have excess product, or for buyers (retailers, food services, distributors) to be short on it. Actually 30-40% of all fresh products sold globally face the challenge of not having a buyer (or a seller) at some point in the value chain. This contributes to high volatility in market prices, hours of work, missed commercial opportunities, and about 25% of all fresh products lost or wasted before they even get to a consumer.

We've designed Fruitspot for those moments when our users need to find a buyer or seller, fast. We're also great platform to find new partners and open new markets, but we shine most when there's have excess or shortage in products and our users need help right away.

What makes Fruitspot unique is how fast we get our users meaningful answers for urgent situations.

"The principals of Green Spirit Farms LLC have researched numerous approaches and investigated various technologies used to grow vegetables using indoor Vertical
Farming techniques.

With the assistance of Omega Garden they have developed a commercial approach that
have deployed at their New Buffalo, Michigan location since 2012.


Their business concept is to use the Volksgarden Rotary Garden units in a multi level system (referred to as a Rotary Vertical Growing Station or RVGS)  as well as a multi level tray system (referred to as a Vertical Growing Station or VGS) growing (non-GMO and organically seeded)  produce near large urban markets reusing older vacant or under utilized industrial or commercial buildings.  This approach using this technology will provide several harvests per year of sustainable vegetables grown ""extremely local"".  This approach will significantly reduce transportation and supply chain management costs and offset large quantities of carbon by locating the farm near the markets where people consume the food, versus in remote growing locations.  This approach using the Omega Garden technology uses significantly less water than conventional farming and typical hydroponic growing systems.  The Green Spirit Farms Sustainable Vertical Farm will eliminate agricultural run off and associated soil erosion impacts improving water quality by eliminating these primary sources of water pollution.

They can operate sustainably 24/7 and simultaneously (at no additional cost) reduce the ""carbon footprint"" associated with traditional food supply.  Their approach eliminates unforeseen severe weather events that negatively impact yields of high value vegetable crops (suchas floods, drought and early frost) resulting in more stable production and stellar risk management - year round. 

They will grow their vegetables using carbon neutral or renewable energy and offer their expertise to others who desire to have fresh, pesticide free vegetables year round.  They know this is the right approach at the right time."

"Flint Hills Resources was born out of a desire to better compete and pursue opportunities in the refining and chemicals industries. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of [Koch Industries](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koch-industries), and has independent leadership and separate financial decision-making authorities. Flint Hills Resources was named for the Flint Hills of Kansas, an area that features lush tall grass prairies, pristine natural springs and beautiful vistas. The company’s headquarters is in Wichita, Kan., near the Flint Hills.

Flint Hills Resources is an independent refining, chemicals and biofuels company. It strives to create value for its customers and society – through the way its facilities operate, its efficient use of resources, the products it produces and markets, and its involvement in its communities. The company has expanded its operations through capital projects and acquisitions worth more than $7.6 billion since 2002.

Its refineries produce fuels that power much of Texas, the Midwest and the Alaska interior. The company's ethanol and biodiesel plants produce fuels that are used across the United States. Its petrochemicals are used to manufacture goods from plastics to building products to packaging materials. The asphalt it produces is used in communities across the Midwest and Alaska. The base oils it markets are the principle raw material used to produce premium motor oil, commercial lubricants and sealants and coatings.

Flint Hills Resources’ manufacturing capability is built upon six decades of refining experience. The company has expanded its production capacity – through acquisitions and capital projects – to meet customer needs in the markets it serves in Alaska, the Midwest and Texas, as well as the global polymers, olefins, aromatics and intermediate chemicals industries.

"Invest in a thriving planet.
Climate change and environmental degradation are the largest existential threats to humanity in the 21st century, and also the largest economic opportunity of our time. These problems are fundamentally issues of economic coordination.

Regen Network, a Techstars-backed company, is a digital platform powered by Cosmos SDK that allows farmers, brands, and institutions to make auditable ecological agreements so that we can rapidly accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture and reverse global climate change.

Regen Network is comprised of two important parts.
We are building a Proof-of-Stake blockchain focused on ecological data, assets, and agreements using the Tendermint Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Join us to help secure what we believe will be the most important distributed ledger on Earth — the ledger of ecological health and agreements.

In addition to creating the underlying infrastructure necessary for ecological accounting, we’re also building real-world applications.

Investing in Regen Network
Now is the time to take bold action to reverse the degradation of this planet. This technology offers us an incredible opportunity to do just that. We are currently in a private pre-sale for our native staking token or offering convertible notes for equity if that is what you prefer. We will personally guide you through the investment process to make it as easy, private, and secure as possible.

Token Mechanics
Regen Ledger is secured through our staking token, the Regen token (XRN). XRN follows the Cosmos Proof-of-Stake consensus and token economics. By purchasing and staking XRN, you help secure this essential infrastructure and the public good it generates, plus staked tokens receive network fees and block rewards as compensation for this important work. For more detailed information please see our economics paper.

Regen Network Development, Inc. is building a contracting platform utilizing Regen Ledger to make easy and accessible ecological contracts between institutions and land managers, who may not have the capacity to interact directly with the blockchain. At the center of these agreements are scientifically-robust ecological protocols that verify a change in practice or outcomes on the ground.

The Market
A conservative estimate of the size of the Ecosystem Service Market came in at $36 billion in 2017. We expect this to grow to $1 trillion over the next decade as climate change accelerates and businesses and governments react to the economic disruption by beginning to value currently-externalized costs. We intend to capture a significant portion of this market.

"SUMMERHILL HAS A TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS POWDER BIOFEUL TO ACT LIKE A GAS
A burner system and biofuel refinement method that fits into our target audience operations as a retrofit with ann outcome of a 30-50% savings in operational heating costs, and a new revenue stream for the customer’s own client chain. 
The result is easy, low cost adoption, and a “perpetual” revenue model based on usage fee for Summerhill. 

This also solves the “bulk” of biomass problem and associated transportation issues
Summerhill possesses the key to the symbiotic relationship between a deep understanding of the agricultural market and economic viability of powdered fuels in the biomass market.

Safe and reliable. Waste and byproducts derived from materials such as Alfalfa, Cane, Citrus, Corn, Flax, Manure, Sewage, Sorghum, Switchgrass, and Wood can be leveraged to create storable fuel and energy. Powdered biomass can enhance efficiency of cellulose to ethanol and diodigester processes by using byproduct for heat recovery in operations. Further, it is well documented across many industries to be easily and safely transported.
Efficiency: Summerhill methods recover high percentages of energy stored in biomass without use of complex fermentation processes, fertilizer, food crops, or cultivated land. 
The Summerhill process is easily inserted in the farm/processor/storage hub model that is inherent to agriculture. While most economic commercialization timelines for cleantech and green technology are expected to be 15-20 years, investors, the U.S. government  and affiliates would like to see a reduced timeline of to three to five years.  Since Summerhill leverages existing assets and ways of doing business, the company is confident it can achieve commercialization with an attractive ROI on a three to five year schedule.

Our product, {R.I.O.S.S.T.} Rapid Intervention Oil Spill Suppression Technology can clean up some of the most insidious environmental hazards known to humankind.  It turns crude oil into protein/enzymes while disintegrating the molecular bonds of the oil, in essence changing it back to its natural state, which is essentially fish food.  It is designed to clean-up oil spills, while at the same time protecting the environment in a safe and cost effective manner.  Unlike toxic, expensive dispersants, our totally environmentally friendly Mitigation Product transforms oil into harmless protein and is effective on land, sea and river water environments.

The method of application is economically superior to conventional systems and is safer as well as faster acting in fighting pollutants with non-toxic's and represents a clear paradigm shift in the way we will go about cleaning up the planet. It offers a significant opportunity for liability mitigation to large oil companies.  In our contract services agreements we anticipate charging oil producers a substantially lower rate for Clean-up mitigation services rendered.

All oil industry companies (and their shareholders), related insurance companies supporting the oil industry, governments, or environmentally concerned groups having anything to do with oil production or its transport over water are going to want this product and mitigation service in their arsenal of support products.

For this small planet, our technology represents a seminal shift in the manner in which we prepare for our collective response to oil spill catastrophes in the future."

The EcoQube is a miniature aquatic ecosystem for your home or office. The heart of the EcoQube is the Aquaponics Filter, which grows herbs, house plants, or flowers indoors while using the same plants to purify and remove physical and soluble chemical waste from aquarium water.
The filter converts fish waste into fertilizer for the plants and the plants then clean the water for your fish, serving as a natural water purifier so that you never need to replace any filters. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) at the top of the unit emulate the spectrum of natural sunlight to ensure that your plant grows with ease. Simply feed the fish, trim the leaves, and reap the rewards.
The same filtration system can also be implemented on larger systems such as aquaculture (tilapia farming), agriculture, localized food production and sewage treatment.
TECHNOLOGY
Current Filters require over $150 and 20+ times of filter changes per year. Most people don't do it resulting in over 80% of fish dying within the first year.
Our aquaponics filter integrates the farming method of aquaponics: the use of plant roots to filter water and directly convert waste into fertilizer for growth. Core advantages include:
1. Full Spectrum Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that emit specific spectrums for photosynthesis- enabling the aquarium to be placed in any lighting condition. 
2. First ever, UV LEDs for water sterilization. 
3. Mechanical designs for optimized oxygen content, root growth and filtration."

"Why snails? For hundreds of thousands of years, snails have been a tasty source of protein. Early Romans began raising snails in elaborate escargotière, gorging them on milk and grain to fatten them. In the 18th century, escargots came to symbolize a cultural elite. This portrayal, however, is inaccurate as the role of escargots (which simply means “snails” in French) is truly a food of the common people as they were a seasonal delicacy that was gathered from the wild by the peasantry. The goal of little gray farms is to once again “democratize” snails as a food for everyone to enjoy by raising them locally and in tune with nature’ s rhythm and to incorporate them into the mainstream diet in dishes that are visually appealing and a culinary delight."

Our first product, the Stixfresh stickers, have the potential to do just that.

The Stixfresh technology, consists of an FDA-approved sticker that is coated with our patent-pending formulation, which is composed of 100% natural ingredients. The sticker is simply peeled and applied to the surface of certain fruits in order to extend its shelf-life by up-to 14 days.

Independent studies have shown that fruits treated with the Stixfresh sticker have increased sweetness, higher retention of moisture, and sustained cellular structure resulting in increased firmness."

"To Soil Less is an alternative agriculture company that specializes in a new form of gardening called gravel gardening or geological agriculture, the study of using rocks to grow and cultivate crops absent of soil and fertilizers. This new science, invented by To Soil Less founder Richard Campbell, operates under the fundamental equation of water + river rock = plant food, referred to as the Campbell Equation.  With gravel gardening, the rules of gardening differ drastically compared to all known types of gardening and agricultural processes. The benefits of gravel gardening are: 1) No soil use; 2) No fertilizer use; 3) Low water needs; 4) Low cost to consumers; 5) Minimal weeding; 6) Fresh tasting food quality; 7)Durable and long lasting; 8) Sustainable both indoors and outdoors; 9) Scalable and 10) Helps address food security issues globally.  The are an estimated 9 sub industries of gravel gardening from decades of academic research with universities to  use in the design of green roofs and balconies to retailing gravel grow cups for the home window sills or in the classroom as an experiment for students K-12.  Gravel also can help feed the homeless and poor, providing a permanent source of several types of produce using very little water.  Overseas, gravel gardening can enable those in places with poor soil quality to enjoy the benefits of sustainable gardening, providing their families with year round access to produce at home.  To Soil Less partners include George Washington University who helps study the geological side of the science, while Tennessee State University's Department of Agriculture studies the agricultural effect of gravel gardening.  The Washington, DC area Ace Hardware is the primary retail partner as Ace  retails the best gravel tested to date by To Soil Less.  There are several media interviews in the market, from in-studio TV news interviews to blogger reviews to press releases that have been picked up in over 200 news outlets."
"Better Earth Agronomy improves farm soil health for higher crop yields on a healthier planet.

Soil plays a key role in almost every farm on Earth. Healthy soils make farms more productive by feeding crops, managing water, and fighting disease. The Earth's four billion cropland acres need to feed 10 billion people by 2050, and this unprecedented challenge makes soil health a top priority for 21st century agriculture.

?Healthy soil also improves our environment. Soils play an enormous environmental role by regulating nitrogen use and carbon flow. Healthy soils can control the environmental impact of agricultural fertilization and help mitigate greenhouse gasses.

?The technologies to optimize soil health are just starting to become available. Advances in DNA sequencing, metagenomics, systems biology, and artificial intelligence are finally allowing us to cost-effectively acquire enough data to understand the complex soil environment and ecology. Better Earth Agronomy is at the leading edge of this effort to acquire these insights and harness them to help farmers."

"BlueHawk Energy Inc (""BHE"")’s project involves exporting US made methanol to China. In China, demand for methanol is very strong and growing dramatically. 
 
 BHE's team of 8 members is skilled and capable. We are raising seed capital. BHE seeks investment from individuals ($10,000 - $25,000 range each) and groups. 
 
 Timing for the project is excellent. US gas producers are highly motivated to find new markets. Low cost US natural gas enables BHE's project to be economically attractive. 
 
 The project uses US natural gas as feedstock to produce methanol. Methanol is used in China to produce olefins which are then used to produce plastics. HIgh volume plastics manufacturing is China's strategic plan. Massive construction is now underway in China to expand olefin production capacity. 
 
 In China, methanol is produced from coal. Over use of coal is causing severe air and water pollution. Since the Chinese Government’s “war on pollution” declaration in March, 2014, coal use in China is increasingly restricted. Today Chinese groups seek alternative sources of methanol from overseas. Several groups plan to make large investments outside of China in methanol plants to control supply costs rather than buy """"retail"""" priced methanol from large, foreign owned companies. Also, Chinese groups seek local country partners for such endeavors. They seek well developed projects that are major investment ready. 
 
 BHE's USA based project is a very good fit for major Chinese investment. BHE's site is already EPA permitted and ready for methanol plant investment and construction. BHE’s team works closely with top engineering and GTL (Gas-To-Liquids) technology companies - skilled in design, construction and operating methanol (and polyolefin) plants. 
 
 BHE's team is experienced in managing petro-chemical projects and working closely with Asian groups. We are in direct contact with several Chinese groups interested in BHE's plan."

"We Are Operating at the Intersection of 3 very Big Trends...

1. Food Safety: Organic, GMO-free, free range, grass fed, etc., are common food lingo, but we rarely hear, “where are our gloves that touch the food made and what is in, or on them?” Our gloves are third-party verified clean and tested food safe, so we can answer these questions!

Gloves are implicated in 15-18% of all foodborne illness (CDC et al) contributing to over 7,000 sicknesses, 19,200 hospitalizations and 450 deaths every year - costing the economy and business hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production and related impact.

2. Sustainability: The US food sector uses 30 billion PVC vinyl gloves a year. These gloves have been banned or discontinued in most western countries due to carcinogenic chemicals, poor food safety, and serious environmental issues... but not in the US!  Vinyl gloves are thick, wasteful and of inferior strength. They also release dioxin at manufacture and disposal and in many cases contain harmful phthalates, even BPA.

We supply a very large US Food retailer with our new tech glove which strengthened their food safety, increased employee satisfaction and reduced their environmental impact by eliminating over 1.2M pounds of glove waste every year.

3. Supply Chain Transparency: The British Medical Association’s In Good Hands report covers labor issues in Southeast Asia’s glove factories. The reports states:

""The manufacture of disposable medical gloves is at high risk for labor rights abuse.""

""...endemic and serious labor rights abuse of workers in factories in Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. This includes both factories manufacturing for small-scale medical glove suppliers, and those manufacturing for major international brands.""

There is only ONE B Corp certified glove company in the world, whose factories are Certified Child Labor Free!"

"AFS is focused on transforming the way food quality is measured.

Agricultural Food Systems (AFS) is a company focused on transforming food quality measurement. It seeks to increase value and build trust among agricultural producers, processors, and consumers. AFS offers a new product to assess meat tenderness accurately: the TenderID. 

Large beef processors in the United States have the opportunity to earn over $75 million in additional annual revenue by measuring meat tenderness effectively. According to the USDA, “tenderness is the most sought-after guarantee for all levels of the meat industry's sales cycle, & surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender.” However, the beef industry hasn't found a way to meet consumer needs yet. This shortcoming means tough beef product remains “a costly & contentious issue for everyone involved in putting meat on the table.”

Agricultural Food Systems provides beef processors with the ability to accurately measure beef tenderness so that they can more effectively communicate meat quality to consumers. Additionally, the company’s product, the TenderID, provides processors with an average of $24.40 in additional revenue per carcass. The product gives them the advantages of more efficient processing and consistently accurate tenderness measurements.

"GrainChain creates an exchange platform with blockchain-based solutions for prompt payment and accountability.

Since the dawn of agriculture, human beings have continually sought higher efficiency and security in the production and trading of food. The modern age has seen the economics of agriculture and soft commodities repeatedly transformed by sudden technical innovations, a pattern which will continue to repeat itself. In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability.

"Thermaquatica is commercializing a proprietary and patented technology for processing biomass (including agricultural wastes), coal, oil sands, and oil shales to high value platform chemicals and liquid fuels. The method, known as Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is simple, using only hot (subcritical) liquid water and oxygen to break down these macromolecular organic materials into their constituent aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The OHD process can also be used for environmental remediation of organic-containing sites, such as oil sands tailings and coal waste ponds.

This modular, environmentally–friendly process produces very little CO2, giving the technology a low carbon footprint. OHD requires no pre-treatment of the feed, or additional catalysts, enzymes or solvents (other than water). The OHD bioliquor can be used as a fulvate-type biostimulant and soil enhancer, and high-value, platform biochemicals can also be recovered as saleable products through an add-on option to the main conversion process. The product suite depends on the choice of feedstock and the process conditions.

Thermaquatica’s goal is to use OHD technology to produce chemicals similar or identical to petroleum-derived products, using low-cost alternative raw materials such as waste biomass or coal. The resulting products can be sold as fine chemicals, used in manufacturing of biodegradable plastics and polymers, and/or converted to liquid fuels.

The OHD technology is described in more detail on the Technology tab from the menu above, and the process is also described in a short video clip in the Media section."

Websites increasingly use code snippets called tags to make their websites run--tags are used for integrating analytics, marketing conversion tracking (pixels), surveys, video, widgets, A/B testing, live chat, and more.

Site managers simply paste their UberTag across their site(s) and then deploy all other tagging right from a browser. So, for example, you can deploy conversion tags on your thank-you pages, live chat on your support site, A/B testing on your landing pages, and analytics and retargeting across every page of your site via a browser in just a few minutes. 

Key benefits: 
> Sites load faster! The core page loads then tags stream asynchronously.
> Launch a tag in minutes instead of waiting for IT.
> Centrally see your tags. See where a tag is loading and see which tags are loading on a particular page."

"E4 Crop Intelligence traces its roots to the hills and valleys of western Iowa.

Looking back to 1999, Greg Reisz, a native of Woodbine, Iowa, had an agronomy degree and several years of experience working in what was then the new field of precision agriculture. The entrepreneurial-minded man decided to return home and open his own firm—which was originally called E4 Sons. The initial focus of the company was soil sampling.

“My customers always appreciated having me walk their fields to provide scouting reports or collect soil samples for testing,” said Reisz, “but they needed more in terms of getting the most out of their data.” In the early years, he started using software from a variety of vendors to generate soil sampling maps and fertility recommendations for his clients. However, he found that using different software systems frequently produced data that was incompatible with other systems, and therefore clouded the process.

With his clients demanding more technology-supported services, Reisz developed his own proprietary software to create better workflow and analytics, which improved the decision-making process by using real, true data. E4 Sons was renamed E4 Crop Intelligence to better describe the business, which had quickly evolved into a full-service precision ag company, with its own proprietary software."

"Let's agree that for too long technology in agriculture hasn't lived up to expectations; too complicated, too expensive and too much effort. We'd lost count how many times we heard 'just make it easy', and that's why we developed the thirdEYE platform. Designed to improve quality and yields, whilst reducing labour demands, our overarching goal is clever simplicity. The platform offers:

Soil Condition Monitoring
Soil moisture and temperature monitoring at multiple depths provides a concise picture of soil condition. Working in conjunction with the platform’s irrigation management ensures precise plant hydration. Soil mapping services, such as EM38, are also employed, enhancing knowledge of soil variability.

Crop Canopy Monitoring
Advanced sensors directly quantify plant stress, working with irrigation management and soil moisture monitoring to moderate stress precisely when required. In addition, canopy sensors continuously monitor for conditions elevating pest and disease risk, lending confidence to your spraying decisions.

Water Management
Capture and logs data relating to your irrigation practices. When coupled with the soil moisture monitoring, this provides a powerful means to water more efficiently. The platform also incorporates water quality monitoring instilling confidence in the health of your crop.

Detailed Weather
By combining on-the-ground weather stations and the resources of the BoM, the platform provides both localised historical observation data, as well as comprehensive weather forecasting, particularly for rainfall and wind. Making extensive use of maps and images, this helps quickly and easily visualise changes in weather.

Mapping
Integrated agricultural satellite and drone imagery, provides a holistic view of crop health. Mapping fosters more granular management, improving both yield and quality outcomes. If you have pre-existing maps and imagery, these can easily be integrated, and made available through the thirdEYE platform.

Remote Control & Alerting

"In the agricultural value chain, the farmer is the weakest link, they have no participation in the price they receive and on top of that, they assume practically all the risk of producing the food.
There are too many intermediaries that without adding value, they collect most of the profits. 
We believe this is the result of the disconnection between farmer and consumer. 
The actual model its that rural communities, end up being poor communities, that means they get bad services, (health, education, drinking water, connectivity, public services), and seen as a whole is not right that those who sacrifice to feed us ending up as the most vulnerable.
This is unfair, unacceptable & unsustainable.
 We all have to eat and we depend on the farmers to keep producing food, so we have to reconnect with them, we must improve their living conditions and restore dignity and sustainability to the countryside.

Given the need to improve income conditions and thereby positively affect health, education, and connectivity, we created a mobile application that allows the farmer to self-certify how he produces their products. The application is a ""Task Manager"" where they are asked to demonstrate how they produce and like Instagram, the form will be for one or several photos, videos and/or some text, all will be georeferenced to the GPS coordinates where their farms are and linked to their digital identity we provide, the tasks are the same as they have been doing for years, but that consumers do not know. 
The farmer download the App, fill out their profile and then add information about what they are producing. 
The first ""task"" will be to walk the farm, with that we create a ""digital farm"" where the following tasks will have to be executed so we can certify the
traceability only of the products produced within those GPS coordinates, the information of the execution of the tasks will be open and will be managed in a public blockchain so that anyone can see the process, in addition, the farmer contributes with social data to tell his story and connect with the buyer on a more emotional relationship."
