Opportunity exists in waste oil management in Canada and many other countries who mine, extract, and process crude oil.

To date, there is an estimated 10 billion tonnes of oil sludge waste on the planet, and this volume continues to grow every minute. None of the more traditional methods for waste disposal and treatment really works on oil sludge.  There have been many attempts at providing a viable long-term solution for the industry to treat oil sludge. So far, the industry has only made small advances. In reality, this is not due to a lack of possible solutions or resources, but it is more down to a lack of will and desire by the industry to tackle this issue head on.

"The solution that Oneka developed takes the resource and energy off the ocean to provide drinking water. 

It consists of buoys that take the ocean’s waves to make its saltwater fresh. As the waves hit the buoys, they do a vertical pumping movement which pressurizes the seawater through reverse osmosis (RO) membranes to produce drinking water. The produced water is pumped by the buoy through an underwater pipe to the clients on the shore.

The all-in-one units produce water from the ocean autonomously at a cost-competitive price without any recurring fuel costs. Furthermore, this new drinking water supply, doesn’t take any precious coastal area or makes any visual impact as other renewable energy solutions.

Echologics was created to solve a gap in the market that it is next to impossible to locate leaks on plastic pipe. What we discovered after that is the same physics relates back to large pipes. So, not only could we be successful on plastic material but we could be successful on large high value pipelines and that was kind of the thing that changed the whole course of the company. 

Evolving out of that is the fact that our correlator was so good that we were able to do pipe condition assessment and monitoring out of it as well and come up with a non-evasive way to get pipe wall thickness. So, it was an evolution that started from the basic premise that most leak detection doesn’t work on plastic pipe.

These standard methods of industrial waste management have been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have negative long-term effects on our environment.

Our Solution…

Responsible Energy’s multi-patented Free Radical Gasification (FRG™) solution can competitively protect the environment by destroying waste, while at the same time produce a multitude of renewable resources. The secret of the FRG™ process is the precisely controlled generation of a >5,000oC (>9,000oF) conversion zone. At this temperature, similar to that of the sun, molecular bonds are broken apart creating a valuable clean synthesis gas (syngas)."

"New Earth Waste Services was established mid 2014 with plans of revitalizing the waste service industry. New Earth will use sustainable practices in waste removal, while at the same time educating clients on waste disposal. The focus will be on medium to large construction companies - a growing industry in Alberta. Alberta is the right province to start such a business with its business friendly culture as well as being the province generating the highest waste per-capita.

The waste collection and management sector continues to hold interest of investors and large companies with regular acquisitions and investments. This is in large part due to the fact that the waste business is less vulnerable to economic cyclicality than most other transportation businesses. Revenues associated with waste collection and transportation continue to climb even through the economic downturn.

Its objectives are to increase energy production from renewable sources, save energy and reduce omissions as outlined in the European environmental policy. 
TerniEnergia has set a strategy for the future with the following lines of development:
-	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: In 2014/2015, construction for a leading European utility company of two PV plants in South Africa for an amount of approximately EUR 140 million is planned. In the short term TerniEnergia also plans to establish a company in a joint venture with Al Hamed Group, named TerniEnergia Gulf LLC, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, whose share capital shall be divided as follows: a majority stake of 51 % to be owned by Al Hamed Group and 49 % by Italeaf. The company will operate in the fields of power generation, waste to energy and waste management. By 2014 TerniEnergia expects to open the first sites and start the construction of a plant for the recovery of used tyres in the Middle East.
-	ITALIAN DEVELOPMENT: There is great potential in the growing sectors of smart energy and energy efficiency. In particular, the company has started negotiations for the acquisition of Free Energia S.p.A. A successful acquisition will, thanks to the sales network of Free Energia, allow for a completion of the downstream value chain for power generation plants owned by TerniEnergia. In addition, [TerniEnergia has acquired all the remaining outstanding shares of its portfolio company Lucos Alternative Energies in July 2014. The two operational investments will jointly allow for strong potential synergies and opportunities for the integration of the businesses, which will be the basis for a strong growth in energy efficiency and enhancement of energy production from renewable sources.] TerniEnergia will also continue strengthening its portfolio of environmental assets, completing a new facility for the treatment and recovery of ""secondary raw material"" of used tyres in Northern Italy and utilising a new plant in Southern Italy for energy recovery through anaerobic biodigestion and composting. Finally, the new plant for the treatment of industrial waste fluids in Nera Montoro, is as of [the day of this Company Description] in an advanced authorisation phase. Once completed, it will intercept a substantial demand in a market segment with high technological content and high growth prospects.
-	STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT: TerniEnergia will focus on business lines with major developments. Concentration will be on power generation with full technological independence by diversifying the sources and technologies available. By doing this TerniEnergia enhances its opportunities in the short term and has the flexibility to meet changing demands in the future. TerniEnergia intends to have a balanced portfolio for each country in the process of internationalisation of PV, EPC and environmental business. In particular, TerniEnergia continues to undertake intensive scouting activities to promote development projects in the most attractive countries for the installation of large-scale plants within the sectors PV, biomass, biogas and energy recovery from waste.
On the financial side, TerniEnergia intends to strengthen its excellent reputation with investors through its presence on the Italian Stock Exchange, in order to become a candidate for an investment platform for institutional investors. TerniEnergia wants to do this by creating the right conditions, through the stability of cash flows and using debt in an efficient manner with respect to changes in the demand of the market."

"Who we are.
Wastewater Science is the winner of the 2015 Maltese Business Idea Competition Climate Launch Pad. The idea has been vetted by scientists and business leaders and we are working to bring the idea to market. This buisiness will help give us the solvency to fight climate change at one of it’s most potent sources.

We have a global plan to deal with agricultural wastewater profitably – for everyone involved. Our plan is to install these units where they are needed most and empower the people in each area we sell them to be green entrepreneurs. The result is a reduction in the number one source of environmental stress - waste in the animal agricultural industry.

We have formed a company to enact our plan and are building our prototype.

Every three installs = a free unit for a deserving community. Every unit group also requires a vermi-composting farm – these farms will be an opportunity to educate and support green entrepreneurs. Wastewater recovery from organic waste is desperately needed in developing nations and we want to fill that gap.

Effects on climate change from installing our unit

Lower energy costs.

Reduced carbon footprint

Third party tests done by The Royal Institute of Technology and Swedish Environmental Research Institute (Sweden), Clarkson University (US), Manta Inc(US) and Anton Paar (Austria) have confirmed that Xzero technology is more efficient than existing technologies in removing nanoparticles from water.

In January 2015, Xzero started to industrialize the technology in co-operation with researchers at the Royal Institute of technology in Stockholm, Sweden and at the leading European organization for microelectronics development – imec in Leuven, Belgium. Testing of the first full scale prototype of the industrialized equipment commenced in August 2016 and final industrialized equipment is slotted to be delivered to imec during the first half of 2019.

Solvatten is a Swedish social enterprise that brings Solvatten Solar Safe Water System to customers, charities and distributors around the world. We also partner with organisations and micro-finance institutions to increase reach and affordability.

Solvatten is the brainchild of the Swedish inventor, Petra Wadström. The story began in Australia in the early 90s, where Petra was living with her husband Carl and their family. The Wadström’s professional background was diverse, spanning both medical science and the arts.

A charitable branch of Solvatten was founded in 2013, focused on improving the lives of, above all, women and children, living without access to safe water. Contributions made in the US are administered by the Solvatten Charitable Foundation USA, a registered 501(c)(3) organization. Contributions to Solvatten Charitable Foundation USA are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law. 

Living in Australia, Petra was struck by the abundance and intensity of natural sunlight. She was convinced that it must be possible to harness its strength for the betterment of those living in poverty.

Exposure to sunlight was key, as this has the effect of both purifying and heating water. After succesful initial trials of the device several field visits throughout Africa and Asia took place, where Petra and her team began conducting studies to validate the efficacy of her creation in a variety of contexts. Today, Solvatten is used in more than 20 countries around the world reaching more than 260.000 people."

"Many businesses in large distributed industries have a problem with stock being unwanted in one location and desired somewhere else. Takestock.com was created to be an online trading platform to make it easy for owners of stock to sell their unwanted items and to find a buyer efficiently rather than turning to scrap as an option. Takestock is initially focussing on the food manufacturing & agricultural sectors where 600,000 tonnes of food are wasted each year in the UK alone.  

They are an eCommerce platform and believe the future solution to distributed unwanted stock is an e market place.

"Enertechnos was founded in 2013 to develop, patent, and commercialize CTS as a new concept in ultra-low loss cable based on capacitance technology.  Capacitance is the ability of a system to store electrical charge.

CTS uses aluminium or copper in a series of layers formed into two interlocking continuous electrodes.  The layers are separated using a dielectric material, typically polyester or polypropylene.  When connected to a power source, a charge is distributed along the upstream electrode which then transfers a charge to the downstream electrode by capacitive coupling.  Unlike a conventional cable, there is no direct conductive connection between source and load.  The CTS can be designed to have a specific capacitance value, which allows it to overcome the inductance problem inherent in all existing cables and also to contribute extra capacitance by design, benefiting the whole electrical system."

"Kepler Energy was established in 2010 to exploit, with an exclusive licence, an internationally patented 2nd generation tidal turbine developed from 2007 to 2010 by three senior academics at the University of Oxford Department of Engineering Science.

Initial work focused upon establishing the performance characteristics of the rotor at 1:20 prototype scale, financed initially by the University, and then, for a second time, with more detailed instrumentation for stress and other measurements, financed by the Technology Strategy Board and by the company's shareholders.

Subsequent work has involved developing designs for full scale turbines, combined into tidal fences, undertaken with supply chain partners who are each leaders in the offshore and tidal energy arenas.

Kepler has no direct economic competitors in providing access to tidal stream resource where first generation turbines are not economic, and represents the first disruptive technology to positively impact on the economics of power production from this predictable source of sustainable energy. This is because the Kepler turbine is very different to all others on the market - it is larger, scaleable, intrinsically more powerful and patented. It has been optimised to open up new resources in low tidal stream velocity flows (below 2.5 m/s), the most commonly found current strength in coastal waters across the globe. The rotor is deployed in standardised units within a tidal fence arrangement, with the key advantage of generating revenue incrementally during the construction phase, to provide certainty in realising expected equity returns."

Utilising technical expertise across a number of scientific, horticultural and built environment disciplines they have the best mix of knowledge to create practical solutions for a growing worldwide market. This group also includes some of the UK’s leading experts in the area of green and living roofs and water attenuation.

There is an ever growing need for water attenuation on roofs as opposed to simply capturing rainfall in large reservoirs/tanks. Aquaten’s objective is to engineer solutions to manage water attenuation using a mixture of science and nature to tackle the problem. A problem which is increasing and as a result they are experiencing more incidences of flash flooding, which is commonly defined by broadcasters as ‘a number of day’s rainfall has occurred within a few hours’ and it is understood that attenuation of the first 5 mm of rainfall is critical.

They have a range of lightweight green roof solutions which support the aesthetic qualities, whilst overcoming the barriers, such as cost and weight, and so Aquaten can offer products that are easier and more economical to fit than either a green roof or a stand-alone water attenuation tanking system."

Such special nano-platelets create both strength and good elastic deformability that maintains its structural integrity for long cycle life. Results have shown the material to be the most stable silicon anode material known today able to triple the anode specific capacity. The material will be able to work in a variety of battery applications from consumer electronic devices to electric vehicles to utility energy storage systems."

"Acoustic leak detection has, until now, never been applied to automated home or building monitoring due to complexity and cost. MicroPhonon has solved these problems and developed an ultrasonic water leak sensor with these advantages:

* Completely automated for integration into a smart home or building product line.

* Signal processing at the edge; no audio streamed to cloud. Eavesdropping impossible.

* Stand-off detection.

* Low power design for multi-year battery operation

High-frequency acoustics are emitted by pressurized water as it escapes from cracked or leaking plumbing. Acoustic signals can travel a significant distance in air and be detected by a remote sensor.

This technology overcomes the shortcomings of available water leak sensors. There is no need to retrofit plumbing for inline smart meters, which are not sensitive to very low flow rates. Unlike contact water sensors, ultrasonic leak detection is effective throughout the building structure – including attics and crawl spaces where pooling of water is difficult to identify and access."

"SWS Environmental Services is an environmental services contractor that has been providing emergency spill response, environmental remediation, hazardous waste disposal, and industrial cleaning services for the past 30 years.

At SWS Environmental Services (SWS) it is their mission to set the industry standard as the nation's premier turnkey environmental services provider utilizing their knowledge, experience and unparalleled customer support. Their team of highly trained, skilled professionals is dedicated to providing solutions of unmatched value consistently with a commitment to safety, reliability and the long-term growth and success of the company.

As of June 20th, 2011, Eagle-SWS officially changed it's name to SWS Environmental Services. The new name and logo better conveys who they are and what they do.


In November of 2008 with the merger of Southern Waste Services, Inc. and Eagle Construction and Environmental Services, L.P. a change in branding and services to Eagle-SWS was unveiled.
Formerly conducting business as SWS First Response and Eagle Construction, SWS is the result of two leading environmental companies joining forces to create one of the largest environmental firms in the United States.


With an expansive range of service centers in the Midwest, the North, the South, and along the Gulf Coast, they have significantly diversified their environmental services portfolio and greatly increased their ability to respond to their clients' environmental emergencies.

With the merger of SWS completed and their new branding in full force, clients can expect a comprehensive set of environmental services available across a broad geographic area, maintaining the same commitment to safety, integrity, and customer service clients have come to expect.

What started as a small domestic waste company in the early 1970s following the deployment of vacuum trucks to a series of oil spills eventually evolved into SWS First Response, a premier emergency response and environmental services contractor. Over the course of 30 years, the company expanded across six states and also developed an entire line of environmental services including site remediation, waste transportation & disposal, decontamination, industrial services and vacuum truck services.

Beginning in 1981, Eagle Construction and Environmental Services was a small commercial construction company serving the West Texas region. After acquiring a variety of heavy equipment to meet a wide range of project needs and demands, Eagle developed into a leading full-service environmental company, providing practical environmental solutions in multiple states."

By partnering with major industry players to leverage their capabilities, Optimus will deliver a fully integrated client solution that is rapidly scalable, creating a $279MM company by 2023.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

In the U.S. there are over 10.8 million medium- and heavy-duty on-road commercial vehicles that consume 39 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually and account for 23% of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. ,   In Canada, these figures are 1.1 million, 13 billion, and 70% respectively.  Fuel costs are the second largest operating expense of a fleet, after labor, accounting for roughly 40% of all costs.  

Fleets are aggressively seeking solutions to reduce fuel costs, even fractions of a percent, because the bottom-line impact is so substantial. Optimus enables fleets to reduce fuel costs by at least 10%, utilize domestically produced fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while allowing a fleet of 100 trucks to save at least $800,000 in annual fuel costs. Of these 11.9 million trucks, approximately 3 million are currently operating on a low biodiesel blend .  This early customer segment represents a beachhead market opportunity of $30 billion.

"In wastewater, treatment plants are “on-grid”. Off-grid means unique on-site treatment for each business, residence, or community. Unfortunately, on-grid treatment plants are crumbling in the face of urbanization. For off-grid, septic tanks are common but are ineffective and can cost $100,000 to install! 
 
This is a multi-billion dollar problem across the US, but it is felt most severely in low-income communities. This problem will only get worse with climate change looming.
 
Off-grid water solutions are necessary for a future where no one has to worry about dirty water. Enter the NuTree - a novel on-site wastewater treatment device. It empowers everyday people to treat their own water by harnessing nature’s methods.
 
The NuTree is no harder to maintain than a fish tank or small garden, which makes the system easy to construct and affordable to maintain. Its modular units, at under $10,000 each, can scale to treat the waste from a single household to a growing business. With a circular, zero-waste system that includes water recycling, bioenergy, and growing crops the NuTree is a force of nature.

"Trevi Systems is a progressive energy-efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) desalination company. 

Trevi System has developed an innovative and highly efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) process, in order to produce clean water from saltwater, brackish water, or industrial wastewater at a much lower cost and energy use as compared to Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. Rather than force water through a membrane as in RO systems, FO relies on osmotic pressure to draw water across the membrane.  In the FO system, the “feed” solution or contaminated water is pumped to one side of the semi-permeable membrane.  The “draw” solution, which has a high concentration of a specially designed chemical and a low concentration of water relative to the feed solution, is pumped to the other side of the membrane.  The water molecules are attracted or pulled through the membrane via osmotic pressure – that is, the water molecules want to migrate from an area of high water concentration to one of low water concentration. Accordingly, water is pulled through the membrane using no energy, leaving the salts or other contaminants on the opposite side.  

The benefits of the Trevi FO system are numerous: it requires only a small fraction, of the electrical energy of current RO systems; it uses relatively low-cost waste heat or low-temperature heat to separate the draw chemical from the clean water; it can be customized to work under specific water conditions such as seawater, brackish water, municipal wastewater, or industrial wastewater; when used for desalination, the system can also be customized to produce brine streams of varying salt concentrations depending on the environmental requirements of the location; and it operates at ambient pressure, avoiding the extra costs of the high-pressure stainless steel plumbing required by RO systems, and the need for expensive high-pressure pumps."

"Avivid Water is wholly owned by Avivid Technologies Group, LLC and is dedicated to preserving and enhancing the world’s water resources by offering a novel solution to cleaning contaminated water. Avivid Water applies its patented TurboCoag© process to the known technology of electrocoagulation (EC). EC systems work by passing contaminated liquids over electrically charged plates creating a reaction, which causes the contaminants to be precipitated out in solid sludge form. Avivid Water has solved difficulties with passivization which will now allow EC to become the system of choice to treat waters with emulsified oils, poorly settling solids and poorly soluble organics that add turbidity, odor and color to water. EC is highly effective for removing arsenic, heavy metals, and soluble organic compounds. Microorganisms are killed in the process of EC treatment. Special applications such as arsenic removal, latex paint extraction and polymer cleanup, coal/sulfur/clay/water separation, and environmental remediation projects are ideally suitable for TurboCoag© . Avivid Water’s system is best described as a combination of a pumping system, integrated with an innovative self-cleaning cell that coagulates suspended material, reacts with contaminates, kills microbes and precipitates a sludge containing these contents. In addition to its self-cleaning features, the system increases current density through the fluid and allows for a smaller reactor for any given volume of water. The design is optimized for servicing of the reactor in the field and can be scaled to treat high volumes of water on a continuous basis. The patent for this product was awarded in April 2013. Avivid Water’s TurboCoag© has achieved a revolutionary improvement over prior EC technologies but maintains common features of EC which are: 

 • Dramatically lowering the costs of waste processing for many contaminants

 • Creating less non-toxic sludge that is suitable for landfill by using no chemicals"

"Rentricity is a renewable electricity generator that targets water utility companies and other large fluid conveyors that install pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) within their pipelines to maintain pre-set pressure ranges. 

Rentricity focuses on an innovative application of hydrokinetic power generation - electricity that is generated by harnessing energy from flowing water, such as the water that flows through municipal drinking water pipes. Water continuously flows through mains and offers the capability to generate electricity year-round, 24 hours per day. Over-pressurization occurs where water is stored at significantly higher elevation than the customers it serves, and must therefore flow downhill to reach them. Utilities and industrial manufacturers typically install pressure reduction valves (""PRV""?)—usually hydraulic devices that maintain pre-set pressure ranges—to relieve the excess pressure. However, PRVs do not perform useful work with the dissipated energy. 

Rentricity's Flow-to-Wire systems mimic the functionality of PRVs while converting the excess pressure into clean electric power. Wastewater, industrial outfall and recycling facilities that return water to natural bodies of water or reservoirs are also addressable using Rentricity's energy recovery systems.  Integrated sensors enable Rentricity to offer its RenFlo information services, which provide real-time system performance data, monitoring flow, pressure, intrusion and contamination while maximizing operational efficiencies.

Rentricity's Flow-to-Wire systems are attractive to water utilities because water utilities currently use about one third of their operating budget to pump water. The Flow-to-Wire system provides very attractive project economics, produce between 30 and 350 kilowatts (kW)—enough to satisfy the demand of between 30 and 300 average homes, or a portion of an industrial facility. Rentricity systems are located within existing water-systems reducing permitting, installation time and environmental issues."

"VesselVanguard was conceived and created by Don Hyde, an experienced sailor and technology entrepreneur. As the owner of an Island Packet 485, Don experienced the frustrations of assimilating the full range of details found in 35 pounds of manuals in order to maintain his boat at the peak of performance and functionality. The design for this simple yet innovative service results from exhaustive interviews with owners, manufacturers, dealers, brokers and service personnel. The increasing complexity and sophistication of today's boats requires greater adherence to the manufacturer's suggested maintenance schedules. VesselVanguard makes this entire process simple and assures optimum performance both on the water and at the dock.

Their mission is to fill in the knowledge gap so that boaters approach each on-water experience with confidence and control. VesselVanguard enables the boat-owner to enhance their stewardship of the boat while also preserving its value. 

The systems designed into a boat by an imaginative boat maker, and choices later made by an owner, are intended to function together to create a safe and comfortable on-board environment. VesselVanguard understands this and its purpose is to decrease the complexity of understanding and maintaining all these systems. This level of acute care delivers the most important and indefinable reality to the boat-owner: Peace of Mind and More Time on the Water."

"Thermaquatica is commercializing a proprietary and patented technology for processing biomass (including agricultural wastes), coal, oil sands, and oil shales to high value platform chemicals and liquid fuels. The method, known as Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is simple, using only hot (subcritical) liquid water and oxygen to break down these macromolecular organic materials into their constituent aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The OHD process can also be used for environmental remediation of organic-containing sites, such as oil sands tailings and coal waste ponds.

This modular, environmentally–friendly process produces very little CO2, giving the technology a low carbon footprint. OHD requires no pre-treatment of the feed, or additional catalysts, enzymes or solvents (other than water). The OHD bioliquor can be used as a fulvate-type biostimulant and soil enhancer, and high-value, platform biochemicals can also be recovered as saleable products through an add-on option to the main conversion process. The product suite depends on the choice of feedstock and the process conditions.

Thermaquatica’s goal is to use OHD technology to produce chemicals similar or identical to petroleum-derived products, using low-cost alternative raw materials such as waste biomass or coal. The resulting products can be sold as fine chemicals, used in manufacturing of biodegradable plastics and polymers, and/or converted to liquid fuels.

The OHD technology is described in more detail on the Technology tab from the menu above, and the process is also described in a short video clip in the Media section."

Not only was the task tedious and time-consuming, but it left a large mess for the homeowner. It made him realize there had to be a better way to find leaks.
As an adult, Rennick became a police officer and supplemented his income with plumbing jobs on the side. While working in the plumbing industry, he grew even more convinced of the need for a less invasive procedure to locate leaks. Rennick decided to team up with an expert to develop equipment, which could locate concealed leaks. After much trial and error, they were able to develop extremely sensitive electronic tools equipped with minute microprocessors. From these humble beginnings, the electronic leak detection industry was born in 1974."

"The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1870 by Alonzo Horton with the mission to guide in the development of San Diego. At the time, the Chamber focused its efforts on several main priorities: bringing railroads into San Diego; encouraging settlement in the area; bringing fresh drinking water to residents; and supporting commerce in the harbor. The Chamber also played a critical role in bringing military bases into the region prior to World War I. It was these efforts that helped the military become a driving force for San Diego’s local economy.

Throughout San Diego’s history, the Chamber has made significant contributions to the San Diego we know and love. In 1909, Balboa Park stood as a mere 1,400 acres of sagebrush until the Chamber raised funds to make it one of San Diego’s largest tourist destination and cultural center points. Likewise, in 1962, the Chamber’s Harbor Committee helped pass legislation that would ultimately help complete the construction of the Coronado Bay Bridge in 1969.

Today, the Chamber is the largest nonprofit advocate for the San Diego regional business community. With nearly 3,000 members representing 400,000 employees, the Chamber is actively involved in local government, regional economic development and providing valuable resources to its members.

OUR VISION

The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce aims to be the most influential business network, advocate and resource for growing commerce in the San Diego region.

OUR MISSION 

To serve our member businesses and employees representing all sectors throughout the San Diego region;To provide opportunities to enhance our members best business interests through networking, advocacy and business resources; and,To partner with our members and other organizations to make the San Diego region more prosperous."

"Ion Alkaline Water LLC is the first retail alkaline water store in North America. 
 
 “Mandeville Louisiana was not my first choice, the store was to open three years ago in Maui Hawaii.” 
 
 I am going to write you as a man about my life and present business. I will try to avoid all of the enticing self-promoting egos, visions of grandeur, innuendos, and flowery promises normally laced in proposals. I retired out of the construction/home improvement industry over 20 years ago. My company had over 5000 employees and subcontractors in five states. I know how to expand, manage, and grow a business with multiple locations. 
  
 Two years ago while living in Maui my wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. With a 96% death rate they naturally took her home to Mandeville. This brave woman turned down chemotherapy and radiation making her possibly the rarest survivor in the world. She will tell you that Ion Alkaline Water is a huge part of her recovery.
  
 I have never been more passionate about anything in my life as I am about Ion Alkaline Water. At 67 I hope to do this quicker than the 25 years it took me to grow the construction business. I have five new locations that I personally plan to open this calendar year.
  
 Mandeville Louisiana was a real retail challenge for several reasons. The people are full of life and very friendly but the state is not known for its healthy lifestyle choices ranking third in the nation for obesity. It is rated at number 44 for the lowest income levels, and 45th on education levels. I personally thrive on challenges, yes I spent some money, learned a lot and the store was a huge success its very first year. 
 
 Their Ion Alkaline Water purifiers generate a huge profit revenue stream of 3 to 5 hundred percent; but it was the rental market that I established that bridged the gaps, and every rental unit turned onto a sale within six months. They are the future of all world water."

"EVAPORATION AT A GLANCE.

- 2.3 trillion gallons of water (7 million acre-feet) are lost in Texas every year to evaporation: 6.3 billion gallons per day. That's nearly two-thirds of water used for agricultural uses in the state and several times the amount consumed as drinkable water.

- 50% of water lost is to evaporation in many large reservoirs in the Southwest. These enormous losses are offset by massive reservoir projects, desalination plants, and ever longer pipelines, all at enormous economic and environmental cost.

- <1% of the water on Earth is available to humans and other members of the biosphere. The other 99% is in oceans, locked up in the polar ice caps, or in the atmosphere. After the effects of evaporation, how much does that leave us?"

"Tusaar is a consumer service company commercializing a metal removal water treatment technology initially. 

Tusaar was established in 2009 to commercialize a metal sequestering technology developed at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The development and research have been funded by the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy.

Most industrial and environmental waste streams contain more than a limited number of polluting metals that need to be effectively removed before the water can be safely discharged. The vast majority of current media-based technologies target a limited number of metals and operate under strict conditions. Other separation technologies need complex systems to operate and are sensitive to various contaminants regularly found in these waters.

The Tusaar technology involves the surface treatment and impregnation of granulated activated carbon with environmentally friendly organic compounds. It works in an acidic environment, targets over 40 different metals, requires minimal pre-treatment, and is simple to use. In most applications, the metals sequestered can be recovered if necessary although preliminary testing shows that metal saturated media also passes EPA mandated TCLP tests.

The technology has one issued patent and two pending. It will find application in treating industrial waste and process streams, recovering/recycling rare earth & precious metals and the sequestering of actinides.

The technology offers significant advantages in its ease of application, cost, and wide applicability."

"RENEWABLE PETROLEUM OIL REPLACEMENT       

Duckweed USA is the licensed developer of a patented new technology that produces a clean and renewable petroleum oil substitute from algae or waste water. Our LVKN Synfuel Production System is the first system of its kind that can produce large, price-competitive quantities of clean synfuels, with no adverse side effects to the environment. Our revolutionary process converts the organic compounds of the biomass into alkanes, which are chemically identical to the petroleum oil used to make gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil, and we can finish it into those products for less than the cost of refining fossil fuels. 

The LVKN Synfuel Production System produces upwards of 30 times the amount of oil per acre than the traditional method of extracting oil from aquatic biomass, yielding upwards of 300,000 gallons of oil per acre annually. Each LVKN Synfuel Production System harvests a consistent daily yield of oil 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, virtually creating a renewable and sustainable “oil well” that never dries up.

Our approach to converting aquatic biomass to synfuel requires no harsh chemicals or pollution producing processes. Only solar and wind energy are used to create our fuels that burn cleaner and work seamlessly in existing engines, eliminating the harmful sulfur exhaust as produced from petroleum based fuels.

We are offering investors the opportunity to earn assured, high returns while supporting a cleaner environment. To read more about our process, please see: www.DuckweedUSA.com"

Each year tens of millions of tons are used for packaging, storing, and serving. Seventy-six (76) percent of all EPS produced ends up in a landfill.

"KEMET Corporation, as we know it today, was officially formed on December 21, 1990. However, the history of KEMET actually began a long time ago.

Kemet Laboratories was established by Union Carbide Corporation in 1919 to purchase the Cooper Research Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which had invented a promising high-temperature alloy. The name ""KEMET"" is a blend of the words ""chemical"" and ""metallurgy."" KEMET's first product used this high-temperature alloy for grid wires in vacuum tubes. In 1930, the product line was expanded to include barium-aluminum alloy getters, an essential element in vacuum tubes.

KEMET's development of automatic machinery allowed production of high-quality getters in the huge quantities needed to match the rapid expansion of vacuum tube usage. In fact, it is estimated that over 80% of the vacuum tubes used by the Allies during World War II contained KEMET getters.

The business continued to grow and prosper until the early 1950s when Bell Telephone Laboratories invented the transistor. As the transistor began to displace vacuum tubes in electronics, the getter business stagnated. Fortunately for KEMET, Bell Laboratories had also invented the solid tantalum capacitor, which complemented the use of low-voltage transistors (semi-conductors) in electrical circuits. Since Union Carbide had experience in the fields of high-temperature metals and alloys, the solid tantalum capacitor was chosen as KEMET's ""new product"" to complement the getter product line and to provide the vehicle for future growth."

"Established nearly 90 years ago, Universal Electric Corporation (UEC), the manufacturer of Starline, has grown to become a global leader in power distribution equipment. Originally founded in Pittsburgh, PA USA as an electrical contracting firm, the company began manufacturing in the mid 1950’s.

The Starline brand was first introduced by the idea of creating a smartly-designed, stationary yet flexible overhead power supply system. This idea eventually morphed into Starline Track Busway; today’s industry-leading overhead electrical power distribution system.

By continuing to promote the concepts of innovation and smart yet simple design strategy, the Starline brand has evolved to include four main product lines: Track Busway, Plug-In Raceway, Critical Power Monitor (CPM), and DC Solutions. For decades now the Starline suite of products has provided industrial, retail, laboratory and mission critical and data center facilities with the most flexible, reliable and customizable power distribution systems on the market today.

Starline Track Busway is a revolutionary, overhead power distribution system that is available in various sizes from 40 to 1200 amps. The systems most unique feature includes a continuous access slot, meaning power can be tapped at any location. This flexibility makes it the ideal solution for environments that are looking to expand or have the ability to change layouts; or those who would simply like to have these options available for the future.

Other main benefits of the Starline Track Busway product include reduced facility construction costs, faster installation and the ability to customize solutions to fit your needs. Starline Plug-in Units can also be disconnected and connected without de-energizing the busway and the product requires no routine maintenance.

Starline Plug-In Raceway incorporates the concept of flexibility in a wall-mounted power distribution system. Instead of having fixed outlets along a wall that come with traditional wiring methods, Plug-In Raceway offers receptacles that can be snapped in anywhere along the installed backplane- supplying a connection to power wherever it’s needed.

Starline Critical Power Monitor (CPM) combines revenue-grade metering accuracy with the flexibility to choose how information is communicated. In addition to the optional display, a variety of Ethernet and serial communications interfaces facilitate seamless integration with BMS and DCIM packages. Starline CPM may be configured for Track Busway applications, as well as standalone sub-metering.

Starline DC Solutions was created to offer a powerful, direct current (DC) alternative for data centers. As large power consumers, data centers require power support systems with flexible modularity, higher efficiency, more cost effective reliability, and a smaller footprint while enjoying the security of global safety listings. Starline DC Solutions has developed the unique power support system technology that makes DC power for data centers a reality.

From the recent addition of DC Solutions to the launch of the new Critical Power Monitor (CPM), there is a clear commitment to sustaining Starline’s position within this industry. The company’s focus on innovation continues to pave the way for safer and more reliable power distribution systems."

"WHAT WE DO

Simply Grid provides a solution for on demand access to grid electricity. Our proprietary technology enables access to on-site, self-service electricity via industry standard charging stations and in-wall outlets for customers who initiate service with their mobile phones.

MARKETS WE SERVE

Powering the mobile food industry
There are over 25,000 food carts and food trucks in the United States. This is a rapidly expanding space, and the food truck rodeo phenomena is rapidly spreading to cities throughout the country. Their legacy source of energy, gas or diesel powered generators, is both expensive for the vendors as well as a pollution and noise nuisance. Our solution enables private lot managers and municipalities to provide electricity to these vendors who can meet their energy needs at a significant cost savings while providing a better environment for everyone.

Idle reduction for public service, delivery, and fleet vehicles
Engine idling is a major problem for smog, urban air pollution, and greenhouse gases, especially in large diesel engines. According to the EPA, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines consumes over 1 billion US gallons of diesel fuel and emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 200,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen, and 5,000 tons of particulate matter into the air each year. Our solution enables vehicles such as ambulances and delivery trucks to connect to the grid for energy to power their equipment or refrigeration units rather than idling their engines.

Managing electricity access at marinas and RV parks
There are more than 8,000 marinas and 13,000 RV parks in the United States. Many of these facilities either have no capability for the automated provisioning, management, and billing of electric service, or they have a legacy RFID card system which leaves customers unable to check their usage and presents proprietors with a myriad of operational challenges and customer support issues. Our solution provides both a metering and control capability to these locations which can enhance their revenue generation from electric service and streamline their operations."

"JUST BECAUSE YOUR GRANDFATHER DID IT THIS WAY FOR 50 YEARS, DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT. New Mousetrap! Half the installation time!!

The Easy2Install switch and outlet system is the Professional and Do It Yourself solution.
The system consists of combined face plate and switch or outlet units which include prewire connections
to the switches by connector rail and standard terminal connection plugs. The Easy2Install electrical
connection system is all incorporated into the faceplate, covered for safety and labeled for the easy
install in minutes. Wiring a home or room with the Easy2Install unit is as easy as it gets for the
beginners and professionals and most important you reduce install time. The faceplate Includes an
easy peel off, paint mask. The system is manufactured of quality fire retardant materials
and components, all standard to the industry.

The pressure on electrical contractors today to be competitive and faster on the job with quicker completion dates is standard in the industry today. Most electrical contractors are being forced to pre-build the back box and wire connections ( top picture ) in the back of their warehouses across America. Then they ship to the job site to help with reaching ever shortening deadlines for project completion. The problem is their still spending excessive man hours to pre-build the back box in the back of the warehouse and possibly shipping twice.

Therefor it's costing more money for the 2 step process and then they still have to install the switches and receptacles in a fast paced environment.

That's were Easy2Install, LLC helps the electrical contractor save time/steps by decreasing the installation process. Our all in 1 pre-assembled multi combination switch system is prebuilt at the factory and is delivered as a 1 piece unit that only requires attaching the wire circuits and fastening directly to the back box. The face plate, switches, receptacles, jumpers and protective backing with screw in terminals are pre-assembled at the factory ( looking for manufacturing investors ). We also include an easy peel off paint mask to keep our switches clean during painting.

We understand change takes time but TIME IS MONEY! So, that brings us to the million dollar question. 50 years with no new mousetrap like top photo or new time saving mousetrap like Easy2Install's all in 1 pre-assembled switch system. You be the judge.
