"Accessible Information.

The world is full of information, however, 96% of it is presented in written format only.
Documents, websites, signage, product information, instructions, larning materials, contracts, etc.
In order to consume any printed information, individuals must have the ability to read and understand content.
However, only 50% of all people in the western world can do this. The other 50% have restricted access to information, due to illiteracy, language deficits, age, and visual impairments.

Population in EU:
•	25% aged over 65
•	13% functional illiterates
•	10% with language deficits
•	3% blind or visually impaired

Furthermore, according to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, all individuals should have access to information on all products, services and facilities.
The respective EU Directive is aiming at multi-sensory channels for information provision. Yet, only 4% of all information is currently compliant with these regulations.

To solve this problem for all people, our solution focused on adding audio format to any written information - accessible, offline and free of charge.

In 2012 we started experimental development and came up with a coloured data matrix code, that contains all the information in the code itself - the Speech Code.

These codes can easily be printed anywhere for users to scan with the free apps for Android and iOS.
Information access is possible any time and anywhere, regardless of internet or phone connectivity.
For added personalization, users can adjust the rate of speech, font size, contrast, and language in the app.

In 2014 and 2015 we moved to market research and pilot projects. Last year, we acquired 30 paid proof of concept customers in the tourism sector. This industry is an ideal test-environment due to a positive image, international users, access to user feedback, and easy production processes. All customers have extended their annual licenses due to positive feedback from their users.

To enable audible information directly on pharmaceutical products, fast moving consumer goods or any other consumer product, we additionally developed the talking Product Label in 2016:
These codes read out the information about the product, its ingredients, expiration dates and the correct usage and can warn about individual allergenes.
The product labels have the capability to present a full spectrum information in multiple languages in a 2.0x2.0cm square, making it a very cost effective method of information production – suitable for mass production.
Less space also means less paper, which makes Speech Code an eco-friendly technology.
The text-to-speech technology supports over 40 languages, making our technology globally scalable.
As data transmission works offline, data integrity, immutability of content and data privacy of the consumers can be guaranteed.

The fields of application to support product safety and social inclusion, are numerous. Some potential uses include:

•	Package Leaflets and Product Information
•	Citizen and Patient Information
•	Instructions and Safety Information
•	Signage in Buildings and on Streets
•	Public Transportation
•	Tourist Points of Interest
•	Websites, Documents and Collateral Materials

We currently establish a distribution partner network with so far 9 partners for tourism in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France, Bulgaria, Israel and the US.
Also we have entered a cooperation with a packaging company for pharmaceutical products to bring SpeechCode into this market and to add an anti-counterfeiting solution into our Speech Codes.

While many organisations dealing with accessibility and inclusion, such as the Zero Project Foundation, ENAT/Pantou, the Austrian Federal Health and Food Safety Agency as well as associations of the blind support our technology, the major challenge for us is to create global awareness with the big pharmaceutical and FMCG brands.

Local and societal impact /USP:
There are a number of people who can benefit from our SpeechCode technology, including the elderly, the blind and visually impaired, individuals with cognitive disabilities and limited literacy, people with allergies, and even tourists in foreign countries. Especially in areas, where connectivity is limited, unreliable or expensive, SpeechCode can be used everywhere at no cost.

To assure that no budget constraints will prohibit the use of SpeechCode by NGOs, associations of people with disabities or individuals, we are waiving our license fees for such groups, support them with user manuals, etc., so they can produce and distribute Speech Codes at no costs at all.

Enabling information access for all above individuals supports the following UN SDGs:

SDG 3 - GOOD HEALTH & WELL-BEING - audible information on health issues and medicines
SDG 4 - QUALITY EDUCATION - an easy and economic way to provide education material for visually impaired children
SDG 11 - SUSTAINABLE CITIES & COMMUNITIES - providing accessible citizen information
SDG 12 & 13 - RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION/CLIMATE CHANGE - Speech Codes requires 40 times less space (=paper) than script. Just one Speech Codes at a central info point can bring written and audible information to the smartphones of hundreds of users and gets stored for later reference

We are very proud that Dr. Daniela Bas, Director, Division for Social Policy and Development, UN-DESA, has given us positive feedback: ...It is always impressive to see how new technologies are improving the lives of visually and hearing impaired individuals. I will share these documents with our colleagues dealing with disability matters in the Division for Social Policy and Development and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

USPs:
•	printable 2D datamatrix code
•	stickable NFC tags
•	up to 40 minutes of offline speech output
•	42+ languages
•	small size (min. 2x2cm)
•	offline scan needs neither network nor energy
•	online DIY code generation (no voice recording)
•	API available for industrial processes
•	serialisation
•	counterfeiting
•	optional 4-8 PIN protection for closed user groups
•	free app & offline scan for customers (data privacy)
•	accessibility by patented ScanGuidance
•	annual license fees for low unit costs
•	immutability of content

Target group for the product: Everyone with a smartphone."

"As Canada's regional economic development agency for Western Canada, Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD) strives to maintain Western Canada’s competitive position by investing in projects and activities that help improve productivity and competitiveness through the development, adoption and commercialization of new technologies and business processes. WD also supports higher value-added production and access to international markets.

Abundant natural resources, thriving technology and services sectors, and low business costs make Western Canada an attractive place to do business. Its geographic proximity to Asian markets, access to inland and sea ports, and excellent transportation services to locations throughout North America have created increased efficiencies in exporting products to international markets.

Western Canada is a significant contributor to the overall Canadian economy. In 2014, Western Canada accounted for 38% of Canada’s real gross domestic product (GDP) by industry and 42% of Canada’s exported goods.1 Western Canada’s export activity is closely linked to the largest economy in the world, the United States, and increasingly to the large and growing economies of the Asia-Pacific. The United States is Western Canada’s closest trading partner accounting for roughly 77% of goods exported from Western Canada in 2014. In the same year, exports to the Asia-Pacific region accounted for roughly 15% of Western Canada’s total exports; a 24% increase over the past 5 years.2

Economic growth in Western Canada is anchored by the natural resources sector, with resource-based goods accounting for approximately 68% of total exported products in 2014. This focus has been a benefit to the economy by providing the foundation for the creation of industry clusters in sectors such as mining, forestry, oil and gas and agriculture."

"Forensic Notes is revolutionizing how police officers document investigations and is intended to be used by patrol officers and detectives alike. Well documented investigations are critical, because these days, even a police officer’s sworn testimony is not enough.  More and more, officer actions are questioned and debated. As a result, notes and associated documentation must be proven to be authentic and contemporaneously written. Contemporaneous notes ensure the officer is seen as credible in the courtroom or during internal investigations. 

However, notetaking is only part of the solution.  Forensic Notes also has an Enterprise component that includes a Cybercrime Investigations Management application and Exhibit Management software for Digital & Video Forensics Units. These specialized investigative units require customized applications to accurately document and manage the submission, assignment and processing of requests for service. 

For these applications, documentation is critical to ensure exhibit continuity and proper disclosure. Plans for our Enterprise applications are in the wire-frame stage and designed with first-hand knowledge of what functionality is required within these specialized units.  

The first contact during any investigation is often with a witness who may hold valuable electronic evidence on their mobile device. It is critical that officers have the ability to quickly acquire this information and make it available to supervisors and lead investigators so that critical and time-sensitive decisions can be made. This is why we created Forensic Witness.

There are almost 18,000 separate Police Agencies in the United States representing over 670,000 sworn members. The majority of these members still rely on paper notebooks and are therefore in a great position to move towards electronic notes as more agencies embrace technology and the cloud."

"Regina is located on Treaty 4 land and within the traditional territory of the Metis.

Indigenous people have lived in this region through many thousands of years. This area was one of the important places where Indigenous people would come to hunt the roaming herds of bison. They began to stack the long bison bones into large piles in an effort to honour the animals’ spirit as the bison herds were becoming depleted due to overhunting by non-Indigenous hunters. Indigenous peoples named the area oskana ka-asasteki, which roughly translates to “bone piles”.  European explorers, fur traders and settlers translated this to Pile of Bones.

European settlement began in the 1880s as an agricultural community and served as a distribution point for farm materials and produce. As the settlement grew and became established, it was renamed Regina (latin for “queen”) after Queen Victoria, who was the British monarch at the time.Regina became a city in 1903. Two years later, Saskatchewan became a province and chose Regina as its capital. Today, this diverse and vibrant community is one of Canada’s fastest growing major cities."

On March 5, 2015, the international arbitration tribunal rendered an award in favour of Khan of US$80 million plus costs of US$9 million plus interest at LIBOR plus 2% from July 2009 to the date the award is paid.

"In the fall of 2015, we started our work on taking the Staffanstorp municipality's website one step further, by developing the web following the tips and views we have received in recent years.

In 2011, the municipality went from an ordinary static website to an active, user-friendly and open site. A website that changes based on you as a citizen and your wishes. A website where you as a citizen can have a dialogue with the municipal officials. An open, straightforward and accessible site.

In the fall of 2010, we started this work on our new website by analyzing the visits of the existing site. This work showed that there were many different types of visits and visitor behaviors, and that our view of how our information was presented did not always correspond to the direct needs and / or behavior of the visitors.

Therefore, we chose to work on the entire site and open up to the need that the visitors showed. While we have wanted to work with this transparency, we have also constantly kept in mind that there are areas where we, as an authority, municipality and democratic organization, must present information in accordance with laws & regulations, and in accordance with the political decisions of the City Council and municipal council takes.

Our overall task is to provide relevant information and functional services that meet the needs of visitors. But it is also our job to listen to you as a citizen and open up for a dialogue.

Our website is not intended as a political forum, as it is officials and not the elected representatives who respond to comments on staffanstorp.se. Development continues. Work on improving a website is ongoing."

In the words of program founder Roland Tibbets: ""to provide funding for some of the best early-stage innovation ideas -- ideas that, however promising, are still too high risk for private investors, including venture capital firms.""[citation needed] For the purposes of the SBIR program, the term ""small business"" is defined as a for-profit business with fewer than 500 employees, owned by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States of America."

Ten Common Sense Beliefs

* We believe in media sanity, not censorship.
* We believe that media has truly become ""the other parent"" in our kids' lives, powerfully affecting their mental, physical, and social development.
* We believe in teaching our kids to be savvy, respectful and responsible media interpreters, creators, and communicators.  We canâ€™t cover their eyes but we can teach them to see.
* We believe parents should have a choice and a voice about the media our kids consume and create. Every family is different but all need information.
* We believe that the price for free and open media is a bit of extra homework for families. Parents need to know about the media their kids use and need to teach responsible, ethical behavior as well as manage overall media use.
* We believe that through informed decision making, we can improve the media landscape one decision at a time.
* We believe appropriate regulations about right time, right place, and right manner exist. They need to be upheld by our elected and appointed leaders.
* We believe in age-appropriate media and that the media industry needs to act responsibly as it creates and markets content for each audience.
* We believe ratings systems should be independent and transparent for all media.

"Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.

Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's hidden services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses.

Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their workers to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country, without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization.

Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members' online privacy and security. Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) recommend Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. Corporations use Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to protect sensitive procurement patterns from eavesdroppers. They also use it to replace traditional VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of communication. Which locations have employees working late? Which locations have employees consulting job-hunting websites? Which research divisions are communicating with the company's patent lawyers?

A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering, and one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently. Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving government IP addresses in their web logs, and for security during sting operations.

The variety of people who use Tor is actually part of what makes it so secure. Tor hides you among the other users on the network, so the more populous and diverse the user base for Tor is, the more your anonymity will be protected."

"About Whitcomb Law, PC
 
 Attorney Joe Whitcomb started Whitcomb Law, PC, to be a full service law firm helping solve clients' diverse legal problems. The firm's focus has always been helping people and businesses interact with government. Joe founded his law firm initially to help claimants applying for disability benefits through the Social Security (SSDI/SSI) and the Veterans' Administrations (VA). He knows firsthand that dealing with the federal government can be frustrating and unnecessarily confusing. 
 
 Many of the veteran business owners that came to Whitcomb Law, PC, indicated a desire to start their own business and eventually become verified as Veteran owned in order to improve their chances of winning government contracts. Joe and his team have grown that practice area from a few small clients who had done little more than file Articles of Incorporation, to more than 70 commercial clients all over the U.S. By keeping the practice areas federal, Whitcomb Law has effectively thrown off the geographical limitations that encumber many law firms. By maintaining a largely transactional and administrative practice, the firm is able to expand its scope, while minimizing infrastructure costs.
 
 By creating a hybrid business model of long term contingency fee work and short term hourly engagements, the firm accomplishes near full utilization of human resources, while maintaining a work-life balance that drastically reduces turn-over and increases team buy-in. Diversification served the firm when government shutdowns, sequestration, and budget cuts were killing other less diverse firms. The firm's focus in advertising in online mediums including well placed PPC campaigns and organic SEO efforts have increased its visibility nationally. Any outside investment would be used to further increase this visibility as well has hiring the attorneys and legal staff needed to serve the additional clients.

"The White House is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the United States. It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Washington, D.C. and was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born and-trained architect who won a competition organized by President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1792.


President John Adams, elected in 1796 as the second President, was the first resident of the White House. Abigail Adams, President Adams' wife, was known to have complained about the largely unfinished new residence. President Thomas Jefferson, upon moving to the house in 1801, was also not impressed, and dismissed the house as being too big. Jefferson made several structural changes under architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe such as the addition of terrace-pavilions on either side of the main building and single-story wings for storage.


In addition to replacing the slate roof with one of sheet iron, Jefferson further improved the grounds by landscaping them in a picturesque manner. While James Madison was President from 1809 to 1817, the White House was torched by the British in the War of 1812. Although the fire was put out by a summer thunderstorm, all that remained were the outside, charred walls and the interior brick walls. Madison brought Hoban back to restore the mansion, which took three years. It was during this construction that the house was painted white. Hoban later added the South and North Porticos, using a slightly altered design by Latrobe. Thereafter, further more alterations were made.


Today, the White House Complex includes the executive residence, west wing, east wing, the Eisenhower executive office building—the former state department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president—and Blair House, a guest residence. The executive residence is made up of six stories—the ground floor, state floor, second floor, and third floor, as well as a two-story basement. The term White House is often used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture."

"The NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) is NRA's political action committee. The NRA-PVF  ranks political candidates - irrespective of party affiliation - based on voting records, public statements and their responses to an NRA-PVF questionnaire.

NRA resources in the 2008 elections were more widely deployed in more critical battles than ever before. Millions of dollars were spent on direct campaign donations, independent campaign expenditures and on mobilizing the most aggressive grassroots operation in NRA history.

In 2009 and '10, NRA-ILA has continued to build upon that grassroots organization with programs that work to effectively communicate with NRA members and others.

NRA relies on a very simple premise: when provided with the facts, the nation's elected officials will recognize that ""gun control"" schemes are an infringement on the Second Amendment and a proven failure in fighting crime. The importance of this premise lies in the knowledge that, as one U.S. Congressman put it: ""The gun lobby is people."""

"The first edition of The Indianapolis News hit the street on Dec. 7, 1869, at a price of two cents a copy. Former Indianapolis Sentinel reporter John Holliday founded The News. It published Monday through Saturday.


Under Holliday, The News was politically neutral and committed to the community. It exposed graft by Indiana Supreme Court judges in 1876. It pushed for the creation of the first city charter and a Chamber of Commerce. The News fought an attempt by Standard Oil Co. to distribute natural gas in Indianapolis.


In 1909, a libel suit was filed against The News by the federal government when the newspaper questioned Theodore Roosevelt’s work on the Panama Canal deal. Editors of The News were indicted but refused to be tried in Washington, saying the trial should be held in Indianapolis where the alleged libel took place. The judge ruled in favor of The News, and the ruling still stands as a landmark victory for the freedom of the press.


Holliday ran the paper until ill health forced him to sell to a group of investors led by William H. Smith of Chicago and Charles Warren Fairbanks. Fairbanks was a former secretary of state and served as vice president during Theodore Roosevelt’s second term. Smith served as publisher until his death in 1896. His son Delavan Smith was publisher from 1896 until 1921. Fairbanks' sons Warren, Frederick and Richard would serve as publishers successively from 1921-44. Under Warren Fairbanks, The News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for an 18-month campaign to cut waste in city and county government.


The News would become Indiana’s largest newspaper and would be known as ""The Great Hoosier Daily.""


In 1948, Eugene C. Pulliam purchased The News from the Fairbanks family and remained its publisher until his death in 1975.


When The Indianapolis Times folded in 1965, The News became the city’s only evening newspaper.


Eugene S. Pulliam became publisher in 1975 after his father died and served until his own death in 1999. Dale Duncan was named his successor. The trend of declining circulation and the demise of afternoon newspapers across the country had finally hit The News. In 1995, the newsroom staffs of The Star and The News merged, but the editorial staffs and pages remained separate. On Oct. 1, 1999, The Indianapolis News published its last newspaper.


The Indianapolis Star celebrated its 100th anniversary on June 6, 2003.


The brainchild of Muncie industrialist George F. McCulloch, The Star challenged the two existing morning newspapers in the city, the Journal and the Sentinel.


McCulloch paid a balloonist $650 to drop red stars on the city in the days leading up to the launch on June 6, 1903. Others were dropped from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which had been dedicated the previous May.


A year and two days after The Star began, it absorbed the Journal, and in 1906 it purchased the Indianapolis Sunday Sentinel."

"Supreme Court of U.S. is the highest judicial body in the United States that leads the federal judiciary. It consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent (majority vote) of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices effectively have life tenure which terminates only upon death, resignation, retirement, and conviction on impeachment.


The court meets in Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States Supreme Court building. The Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases.


With few exceptions, the life of a U.S. Supreme Court case begins when a lower court case ends since the Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeals. The losing party in a lower court case must request entry onto the court’s calendar. The justices then decide whether to hear the case, the crucial factor being whether the case can shed new light on an issue of constitutional law. The court hears about 100 of the 10,000 cases that compete for a spot on the court’s calendar each year.


Once the court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from each side must submit written arguments. Each justice will typically choose a clerk to review the arguments and prepare a memo, outlining the issues the case presents. The lawyers for each side are informed the date of their oral arguments. Shortly before oral arguments, justices review the memos so that they can anticipate each party’s argument and the theories behind their reasoning.


Each party receives half an hour for their oral arguments, including questions from the justices. The justices are seated in order of seniority with the Chief Justice seated in the center. Justices often question the lawyers as their arguments proceed.


Supreme Court of U.S. was established in 1789 and is based in Washington, District of Columbia."
"For more than 30 years, NRI has focused its strategic research initiatives on the development, manufacturing, and marketing of state-of-the-art pipe repair solutions that withstand the tests of time, water, and other elements. The company’s Syntho-Glass® system has proven to be reliable enough for the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard, and international natural gas and oil industry conglomerates to require Syntho-Glass® availability for all pipe repairs.

Founded in 1982, NRI developed its pipe repair systems for application within the marine industry. As the original inventors of the moisture-cured, pre-impregnated composite material, NRI caught the attention of the U.S. Navy and, in 1996, secured its first contract with the U.S. government requiring NRI’s Syntho-Glass® system to be carried aboard all Navy vessels.

The company’s success with the U.S. Navy led to the creation of larger and more robust materials. This expansion of its product capabilities allowed for the exploration of opportunities within the natural gas and oil industries.

"The Arabia Foundation believes in the power of informed conversation. The Washington D.C.-based think tank was established in 2017 with one primary goal in mind: to provide policymakers, academics, and media professionals with impartial insights and illustrative commentaries on the socioeconomics and geopolitics of the Middle East. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to stimulate productive debate on domestic and foreign politics of key regional state- and non-state entities, as well as shed light on how those political shifts stand to impact the United States. 

The Foundation observes developments as they occur across the Middle East; however, it maintains a particular focus on the nations embedded in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The region and its member countries are currently in the midst of a period of faced-paced change, the social, economic, and political implications of which could drastically impact not only residents of the Middle East, but the global community as a whole. Understanding this, the Arabia Foundation seeks to highlight and spark discussion on potentially significant regional changes, and provide an independent perspective on how these transformations stand to influence life domestic and abroad. 

Anyone who keeps tabs on the region understands how invaluable these politically-independent insights can be; coverage of happenings in the Middle East is often opaque at best and limited by a lack of attention and colored by inaccuracies. The Arabia Foundation aims to remedy this lack of clarity and visibility by publishing reports, penning commentaries, generating analyses, and organizing events that both center on regional topics and stimulate productive conversations about current events. The Arabia Foundation has the capability to do so; the collective experience of the organization is considerable, spanning sectors that include but are not limited to finance, diplomacy, international relations, politics, and U.S. foreign policy. The organization's efforts have been fruitful thus far; in its first year of activity, Foundation experts have published op-eds and reports across significant media entities such as Politico, Bloomberg, and Reuters.

Ultimately, the organization hopes that in providing these published perspectives, the Arabia Foundation will both serve as an invaluable resource for academics, media professionals, and policy experts who need a more layered and nuanced view into the region and provide a well-rounded, objective perspective on the Middle East to the public at large.  

The Arabia Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that functions on the generosity of private donations and corporate support."

"Not only is manufacturing important for jobs and production, but a vital manufacturing sector is also essential to meeting national challenges, including rebuilding U.S. infrastructure, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels. Renewable forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, rely on manufactured components more so than extractable energy such as oil. A vibrant manufacturing sector will be needed to supply the new materials needed to rebuild America’s decaying infrastructure and to create a low-carbon economy.

The manufacturing sector employs workers at all skill and education levels, and is a particularly important provider of jobs with good wages for workers without a college degree. It employs a higher share of workers without a college degree than does the economy overall.

Manufacturing is one of the most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy. It is responsible for roughly two-thirds, or roughly $208 billion, of all U.S. business research and development spending.

U.S. manufacturing employment was relatively stable between 1970 and 1998, and never fell below 16.5 million workers. The United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs between March 1998 and 2013.

So what can you do?

Imagine creating jobs with the swipe of your credit card or helping thousands of unemployed punch a time clock – all because you simply paid closer attention to your shopping decisions.

Buying American-made is the most direct way anyone can support American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs. We, as Americans, have the ability to change our own course, expand our middle class, re-ignite our manufacturing base, and provide the opportunity for those less fortunate to join an expanding middle class."

"The Libertarian Party is your representative in American politics. It is the only political organization which respects you as a unique and competent individual.

America's Heritage
Libertarians believe in the American heritage of liberty, enterprise, and personal responsibility. Libertarians recognize the responsibility we all share to preserve this precious heritage for our children and grandchildren.

Free and Independent
Libertarians believe that being free and independent is a great way to live. We want a system which encourages all people to choose what they want from life; that lets them live, love, work, play, and dream their own way.

Caring For People
The Libertarian way is a caring, people-centered approach to politics. We believe each individual is unique. We want a system which respects the individual and encourages us to discover the best within ourselves and develop our full potential.

Principled; Consistent
The Libertarian way is a logically consistent approach to politics based on the moral principle of self-ownership. Each individual has the right to control his or her own body, action, speech, and property. Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud.

Accepting
The Libertarian Party is for all who don't want to push other people around and don't want to be pushed around themselves. Live and let live is the Libertarian way.

AMERICA'S THIRD LARGEST PARTY
The Libertarian Party is America's third largest and fastest growing political party. Libertarians engage in a variety of projects, working for everyone's liberty on every issue.

The Libertarian Party was created in December of 1971 by people who realized that the politicians had strayed from America's original libertarian foundation, with disastrous results. Their vision was the same as that of America's founders -- a world where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, a world of peace, harmony, opportunity, and abundance.

Libertarians are practical; we know we can't make the world perfect, but, it can be better. Libertarians will keep working to create a better, freer society for everyone.

As William Allen White said: ""Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless you are willing to give it to others.""

WHY NOT STICK WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT?

""Given the low level of competence among politicians, every American should become a Libertarian.""
-- Charley Reese, Alameda Times-Star (California), June 17, 2003

The politicians in Washington and our state capitals have led us away from the principles of individual liberty and personal responsibility which are the only sound foundation for a just, humane, and abundant society.

Government at all levels is too large, too expensive, woefully inefficient, arrogant, intrusive, and downright dangerous. Democratic and Republican politicians have created the status quo and do not intend to change it.

CONSIDER THE LIBERTARIAN OPTION
Substantially reduce the size and intrusiveness of government and cut all taxes.
Let peaceful, honest people offer their goods and services to willing consumers without a hassle from government.
Let peaceful, honest people decide for themselves what to eat, drink, read, or smoke and how to dress, medicate themselves, or make love, without fear of criminal penalties.
The U.S. government should defend Americans and their property in America and let the U.S. taxpayer off the hook for the defense bill of wealthy countries like Germany and Japan.

WHAT AMERICANS WANT

Americans want, and deserve, a political system which respects them as unique individuals; as people who can make their own plans, who can take responsibility for themselves, who are compassionate, and who can and will solve their own problems if allowed to do so.

Most Americans, after some thought, prefer the Libertarian option in politics. Most people in their private, non-governmental, affairs deal with each other on the libertarian premise of mutual respect. You don't threaten your neighbors with fines or jail just because they choose careers or lifestyles different than yours.

Let's hold government to the same standard. Protect us and our rights, and give us the respect we deserve.

TIME FOR ACTION
We hope you can see the benefits of living in that America envisioned by the founders and by their political heirs, today's Libertarians.

We hope you will want to join the Libertarian Party and become involved in our many activities at the national, state, and local levels.

Are you ready for a change in American politics?

For as long as most of us can remember, Republican and Democratic politicians have talked about solving the problems that face Americans; but their ""solutions"" have only worsened the situation -- higher and higher taxes; greater intrusions into our personal lives; more rapes, murders, and muggings; and a crumbling public school system graduating fewer and fewer people who can read.

We believe the American people -- like their counterparts in Eastern Europe -- have seen through the charade of big government. We believe the American people are ready for a fresh approach to the problems that plague us. Libertarian ideas were instrumental in the birth of our country, and they can inspire a return to the individual initiative, responsibility, and prosperity that were once part of the American dream. If you agree, we hope you will join us."

"Flux is a political movement which aims to replace the world's elected legislatures with a new system known as issue-based direct democracy (IBDD). Flux originated in and is most active in Australia, but it is also active internationally, with groups existing in the United States and Brazil. IBDD is similar to liquid democracy, though there are differences. In IBDD, voters would still have the right to vote directly on every issue or delegate their vote to someone else, but unlike in liquid democracy, voters can choose to forego votes on one issue to use on another issue. This creates opportunity cost between issues and allows voters to specialise their votes on the issues that are more important to them. This specialisation of votes allows citizens to participate effectively in issue-based direct democracy without having to focus on every issue as they would in regular direct democracy. Software to implement IBDD is being developed by SecureVote, a startup company set up by Nathan Spataro and Max Kaye to bring Blockchain-based voting to Governments, Businesses and Token Ecosystems."

Key Features
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE is the main data provider and country information, that meet the needs of different segments of civil society, as well as organs of government federal, state and municipal levels.
The IBGE offers a complete and current view of the country, through the performance of its main functions:
Production and analysis of statistical information
Coordination and consolidation of statistical information
Production and analysis of geographic information
Coordination and consolidation of spatial information
Structuring and implementation of a system of environmental information
Documentation and dissemination of information
Coordination of statistical systems and national cartographic

Historic
During the imperial period, the only body with exclusively statistical activities was the General Directorate of Statistics, created in 1871. With the advent of the Republic, the government felt the need to expand those activities, especially after the implementation of civil registration of births, marriages and deaths.
Over time, the authority responsible for statistics in Brazil changed its name and functions a few times until 1934 when it was extinguished the National Bureau of Statistics, whose duties passed to the relevant ministries.
The lack of a skilled body to articulate and coordinate statistical surveys by unifying the action of specialized services operating in the country, favored the creation, in 1934, the National Statistics Institute - INE, which started its activities on May 29, 1936 . The following year, was instituted the Brazilian Geography Council incorporated to INE, which was renamed then Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.
Since then, the IBGE fulfills its mission: identifies and analyzes the territory account the population, shows how the economy evolves through work and production people, yet revealing how they live.

Structure
The IBGE is an entity of the federal government, under the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management, which has four boards and two other central organs.
So that their activities can cover the entire national territory, IBGE has a national network of research and dissemination, consisting of:
27 State Units (26 in state capitals and 1 in the Federal District)
27 Sectors of Documentation and Dissemination (26 in the capitals and 1 in the Federal District)
581 Data collection agencies in major cities.
