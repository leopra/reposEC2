All over Europe thousands of cars are on the road on a daily basis - most of them with plenty of free luggage space that currently remains unused. Our mission is to change this. checkrobin.com aims at revolutionizing the same-day-delivery market by connecting commuters to people in need of fast and easy transport. After finding each other and agreeing on the main terms via the platform, sender and driver can discuss the final details via phone or instant messaging, a win-win-win situation. The sender gets fast and easy delivery of his goods, the driver earns himself a commuting allowance (9 to 29 euros) and the environment benefits as well, as packaging is not required and goods are transported without extra carbon-dioxide emission.

Until checkrobin.com it was almost impossible, or at least uneconomical, to realize same-day-delivery outside urban areas. Using commuters to facilitate the transport, our platform is able to change this and by that tap into a new, highly attractive market."

"Called the ""LinkedIn of EDI"" by some, Nallian's iPaaS is a Data Sharing Platform that helps companies that are part of the same value network to operate efficiently as an agile network, by selectively sharing and using each other’s ERP data.

Enabling Open Data for Companies:  
What Dropbox does for documents, Nallian does for structured operational data. Such data was historically buried in ERPs. Nallian allows owners to selectively publish parts of that data so that business partners can synchronize processes and get visibility on the whole instead of only on their own silo, leading to collective performance improvements.

The packaging as a Community-in-a-box helps visionary companies to lead data sharing initiatives within a community of business partners. 

Nallian took 3 years to build the Platform. Currently, strongest adoption comes from logistic hubs, logistic networks, and shippers that dream of bundling their outbound logistics to drive efficiencies and sustainability. Sample implementations are BruCargo's Cargo Community Hub, and a leading FMCG's initiative CargoStream."

Smart tech is ubiquitous in all aspects of life, and yet, when it comes to protecting your valuables, friends, pets, families they hardly venture to go beyond the obvious channels, created by formal organisation and habits that go way back before modern society was created.

They are a small team of IT professionals, engineers, designers and general enthusiasts in leading an absent-minded way of life (strictly for the purpose of testing their products, of course). Their team of founders gained its experience in the tracking business by helping insurance companies find stolen vehicles and then they decided to be a little less corporate and a lot more fun. Yes, they tried tripping over an ethernet cable, but that did not last - they sensed that they have a mission.

Expect their products to last longer and deliver better accuracy simply because they are not so much about the money, but about the process of technical perfection - if they are to help their human race outsource part of the functions of the brain to technology, then they need to respect the thousands of years of evolution that has made us what they are now."

"Founded in 1882, J.D. Irving, Limited (JDI) has operations in Canada and the United States. JDI is a team of 15,000 dedicated employees, with business units in: Agriculture, Construction & Equipment, Consumer Products, Energy, Food, Forestry & Forestry Products, Retail & Distribution, Shipbuilding & Industrial Fabrication, Transportation & Logistics. 

Since JDI's inception over 130 years ago, their employees continue to build JDI into a diverse group of performance-driven enterprises. It is through their dedicated team using the best practices to make the best products that enable them to better serve their customers - at home and around the globe. 

The seeds of our entrepreneurial diversity were first sown by company founder James Dergavel Irving (J.D. Irving) - the son of enterprising immigrants from Dumphries, Scotland. 

The original company holdings included: a sawmill, gristmill, carding mill, a general store, lumber business and three farms. J.D. was an innovator and a dedicated investor in new methods, equipment to improve productivity and service - a tradition that we carry on today. 

Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving, born in 1899, inherited his father's entrepreneurial spirit and keen interest in business. K.C. was a driven and dynamic builder of enterprises who ""liked to see the wheels turn"". Under his leadership, the business realized significant growth and diversification in the transportation, shipbuilding, construction and retail sectors. 

In 1957, James K. (J.K.) Irving (K.C.'s eldest son) pioneered the company's reforestation and tree improvement programs and expanded our forest products' business. Over the past 55 years the company planted over 925 million trees - a national record in Canada. Trees, being nature's air filters, absorb carbon dioxide to combat global warming. Today, continual reforestation is sustaining jobs and value-added operations that J.K. and his sons have grown over the years. 

Like the generations before them, J.K. and his sons, Robert and Jim, are builders. They believe that good products, superior service, continuous improvement and the front-line efforts of skilled employees are the most important ingredients to success."

PAVE
What if we used computer recognition to let anyone capture a vehicle and complete an inspection using their phone and they could finish a full vehicle appraisal in under two minutes?

Discovery Loft took an arsenal of emerging technologies like computer vision and machine learning and created the ultimate way of capturing and verifying a used vehicle to deliver a ridiculously easy user-experience. 

Take seven selfies of your car and let PAVE do the rest.  

With nothing to download, by only clicking a link opens PAVE's Mobile Capture Module that walks you through a gamified experience that uses the native capabilities of your phone to capture seven images of your car.  

The platform then analyzes these images to gather the vehicle details, including not only the VIN, Year, Make and Model but also the trim, interior and exterior colour and even the mileage. PAVE then inspects the interior and exterior for defects, gives the vehicle a grading and generates a vehicle condition report including the estimated reconditioning cost.  All within the two minutes it would take you to walk around your car.

PAVE's open API service allows developers to integrate its Mobile Capture Module or its image recognition and inspection engine into any digital workflow. 

Making the process of capturing and validating the condition of a vehicle this simple for anyone to use, from anywhere - PAVE's APIs opens up the door for many possibilities.

Gaining this capability can allow for the automation of giving someone a transparent and accurate (vehicle-specific) trade-in value from anywhere within minutes and all the customer needs is access to a PAVE link from the retailer or OEM. A link delivered as a text message, QR code or button on a mobile app or website.  

PAVE is also an ideal way to capture a vehicle's details and condition report to fit an auction's workflow for onboarding cars for both the physical sale and remotely by giving anyone an easy way to post cars on your marketplace directly.

You may not even need the UI, connect your vehicle capture or imaging solution into PAVE's inspection engine and be able to provide instant vehicle condition reports for the vehicles you are already capturing with your hardware. PAVE's APIs do work amazingly for these use cases and many more.

Backdrop.ai
Image Background Replacement API Service 

We love to find byproducts as we build other solutions and Backdrop.ai is one of those stories.  As we were working with one of our integration partners for PAVE, they needed to change the backgrounds on the vehicle images that their system captures for dealers to use for inventory merchandising. To our surprise, they couldn't find an active API service to do this, and they were outsourcing this process to have it manually done. This process took them 24 hours to complete at the cost of 4 USD a car. Well, we love object recognition, so we took on the challenge.  Backdrop.ai is an API service that we built so that their solution can send three images (the original car image, a replacement background and an overlay to promote the dealer and their value proposition on each photo) and within milliseconds the API will post enhanced images back for their system at a fraction of the cost they were paying. In April 2019 we are making Backdrop.ai open to all developers and solution providers in automotive - so they too can also deliver this added benefit to their dealers. 

With Backdrop.ai every captured vehicle image can be enhanced for digital merchandising of a dealer's inventory.  For car images captured during a snow day, you no longer have to retake the shots if the car is still in stock when Spring hits. Dealers can finally use the images taken by the auction to start merchandising their purchases as soon as they are the high bidder on the car.  Save the space and money on buying your dealership that fancy photo booth, a vehicle can now be captured anywhere and merchandised with a consistent background and message automatically by using the Backdrop.ai API service."

"Zigtag is an intelligent, semantic, social bookmarking service. The Zigtag sidebar provides both an intuitive way of tagging web pages (using descriptive words or phrases) and a user-friendly way of quickly retrieving tagged pages.
 
Users tag web pages with semantic tags (tags which have definitions) e.g. if you tag a page with ""Apple"" you can choose ""Apple (computer company)"", ""Apple (fruit)"", ""Apple (record label)"" etc.  Pages can be retrieved using any of the tags which were previously entered or using synonyms for those tags, e.g. a page tagged with ""Car"" can be retrieved by searching for pages tagged with ""Car""? or ""Automobile"" (Zigtag understands Car and Automobile are the same). This allows you to:
 * Keep your tag space organized — you don't end up with ""New_York?,"" ""New-York""? and ""NewYork"" — Zigtag has only one ""New York (the city)""? (although you can search for using ""NY?,"" ""NYC""? or even ""Big Apple""?)
 * Search for your bookmarks quickly and efficiently — the type-ahead helps you choose from tags you've used and also shows their definitions
 * Find what others have tagged effectively — no confusion between ""Stock (soup base),"" ""Stock (equities)""? or ""Stock (inventory)""
 
Zigtag also has a major social networking component; you can see what your friends are tagging and create and join special interest groups. The sidebar notifies you when your friends tag something new, and a news feed allows you to see what your friends are tagging at a glance. It's kind of a ""personal Digg""—your friends' interesting sites are likely to be interesting to you. Zigtag groups form the focal point for collaboration and a central gathering point for people with shared interests."

"CargoSteps is a platform for automated backloads in B2B express and courier logistics built on a cross company real-time track & trace solution that provides proactive status updates.

Processes with SMEs in logistics are very time and cost intensive. The need for transparency and real-time status updates of shipments in the time critical express and courier market is very strong. Also 95% of car to van sized vehicles in this market are driving back empty after delivering a shipment, because those SMEs have only a small regional network that provides them with jobs and with the high pace in this time critical market, they can't organize backloads in time.

An essential USP of CargoSteps is the cross company functionality with multiple parties of every size. Small companies usually have no system at all for their daily work and medium sized companies in this market have only isolated solutions that can't be used with their partners and subcontractors. With CargoSteps they can work with any company worldwide in less than 2 minutes. This opens completely new possibilities like the automated marketplace for backloads which you only have with slow and time uncritical general cargo shipments for big trucks with a minimum shipment size of one pallet. Everything below that gets ignored. CargoSteps on the other hand focuses on shipment sizes usually below a pallet but doesn't exclude any larger shipments.

With CargoSteps' marketplace companies can improve their turnover about 50% while improving their service and freeing resources with the track & trace solution."

The module also offers the option of power negotiation through which you can give your vendors a target rate to further squeeze the rates. The system enables you to win the best rates in both spot rates and contract-based shipments. 

Features: 
Saves money: By deploying the power Recursive Rate Reduction system the module helps you achieve 8-15% cost savings in your freight procurement process. 

Saves time: The module reduces the time taken to create and share RFQ to less than 12 minutes per quote as against the traditional way that takes about 45 minutes per RFQ. The system makes this possible as it automates the process and saves the shipper from the hassle of creating several quote comparison sheets, manually following up with vendors in case they fail to provide certain information in the quote, etc.

Fully automates freight rate negotiation: The module eliminates the need to call and exchange countless emails with your vendors to get quotes and negotiate rates for every single shipment. 

Instant Quote Comparison Sheet (QCS): The system allows you to create a QCS within a click and highlights the best deal, saving your team the trouble of compiling data, manually creating quote comparison sheets and figuring out the best deal.
 
Eliminates the scope for errors: As the system automates the entire process of RFQs, the scope for human error gets eliminated.

Improves communication with vendors: The module helps you improve your relationship with vendors as all the communication happens on a single platform and minimises the scope for any confusion or mistakes. 

Audit trail: An audit trail of all shipments gets created as the confirmation of each vendor is captured on the platform itself. This leads to an increased level of transparency.

Unlimited vendors: As the system automates the RFQ management process, you can potentially invite quotes from unlimited vendors as against the traditional system where the number of vendors is restricted due to several limitations.

GoComet Freight Index (GFI):

The GoComet Freight Index module makes it possible to benchmark freight rates for major ports across the world. 

The module pools in data from over 25,000 quotes that are submitted on the GoComet platform every month. The system considers the top-rated and lowest quoting 10 vendors on each route and runs its machine learning algorithms to determine the GFI. The algorithms are based on those used by the World Container Freight Index and Shanghai Freight Index.

Features:

Benchmark rates: The module allows you to benchmark rates for every route by comparing them to the market rates suggested by the GFI.

Find true market rates: You can figure out the true market rates for both 20’ and 40’ containers with the help of GFI.

Market rate trends: Stay updated with the latest market rates in the international shipping industry.

Invoice reconciliation module:

Industry studies reveal that invoice processing costs around $5 to $12 per invoice. Worst yet, the process is mundane, time-consuming and prone to errors. 

GoComet’s automatic invoice reconciliation module helps you reduce these inefficiencies by 76% and saves 80% of the time taken to match invoices.

The software matches your freight invoices to your original contracts and immediately highlights any inconsistencies to your vendor, saving you the trouble to follow up with them in person each and every time there is an error. 

The system can even auto-approve invoices and notify your payments team, making the process faster and more efficient and reducing payment times to your vendors.

Features:
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Inconsistencies between the invoice and your original quotation are highlighted through a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, contextual language processing and algorithmic programming.

Saves time: Saves 76% of the time spent on manually processing and matching invoices.

Reduces workload: The system reduces the workload of your logistics and accounts team and eliminates the scope for any errors by auto-rejecting duplicate invoices uploaded by Logistics Service Providers.

Automates approvals: The module offers you the option to auto-approve invoices that are up to the mark.

Better audits: Improved auditing process via the ability to time-stamp remarks and comments on each invoice.

Improved relationship with vendors: Improved client-vendor relationship due to better payment cycles and full transparency.

Port delay portal:

GoComet port delay online portal provides free, daily and real-time information on the average and maximum delays at seaports across the world.

The system pools data from the thousands of containers that GoComet tracks each and every day through our container tracking software. Regularly updated, the portal maintains a record of port delays across more than 300 ports.

Features:

Convenience: Convenience and ease of functionality were our key objectives when engineering the product and the result is the most user-friendly platform in the market today.

Instant information: To find information on any port of your choice, simply enter its name in the search field on the port delay portal. The module will then instantly display the average and maximum delay for that port.

Colour-coded: To enhance user-experience, delay classifications have also been colour-coded."

"AgroCenta was founded by two ex-esoko employees, Francis Obirikorang and Michael K. Ocansey in 2015 to improve the agricultural value chain in Ghana. Two critical problems within the value chain, which are the lack of an access to market for smallholder farmers in the rural areas, which subjected them to activities of exploitative, buying from middlemen and the lack of a coordinated truck delivery system to cart their commodities from farms to markets to sell.

AgroCenta’s idea is to solve these age-old problems by introducing an online sales platform that connected smallholder farmers directly to an online market, which has wider geographic size, to sell their commodities. The end result? Exploitative buying was reduced to the barest minimum since farmers were in control of selling their commodities at prices that were favorable to them.

Once a farmer gets offers from interested buyers, the problem of logistics and transportation were sorted using AgroCenta’s patent TrucKR solution that allowed the smallholder farmer in any remote village in Ghana access trucks at the click of a button. You can call it the uber for trucks. AgroCenta is changing the very lives of smallholder farmers by using technology to solve problems they encounter in agriculture."

Airlines are faced with growing direct costs and restricted growth. Baggage touches both pain points; representing a direct cost in terms of fuel, landing duties and handling costs & an indirect cost as a barrier to turning around more planes within the limited daily slots.

Problem: 
Although carriers with fleets of 20 trucks or less make up over 92% of all trucking companies in the United States, they must compete with larger fleets without the benefit of the premium-priced software tools and economies of scale savings available to their more resourced competitors. Thus, many carriers juggle multiple software subscriptions and/or manual processes to carry out their day-to-day fleet and business operations. Synthesizing the various outputs from separate tools costs small business owners time and money that could be better utilized elsewhere.

Solution:
Truckish’s Fleet Management Solution saves carriers time and money by integrating the tools they need into a comprehensive SaaS system that is affordable to the average trucking company. These tools include dispatch, vehicle diagnostics, tracking and maintenance, ELD and Hours of Service compliance, IFTA calculations, contacts management, and accounting with easy integration to QuickBooks and payroll systems. 

Carriers use the Truckish web platform to manage their customers, team, and assets. Our automated workflow seamlessly facilitates every load from dispatch through to invoicing and driver payroll. Drivers connect to the platform via the Truckish mobile app, where they monitor their assignments, track their hours of service, and manage load documentation and contacts.

"Intalex have created a global trading platform that enables employers to trade with recruitment companies, creating efficiencies, reducing risk, reducing cost and improving time to hire. Intalex offers a sophisticated trading platform that affords ease of use and simplicity for all users.

The fundamental value proposition of Intalex is to leverage the power of our secure, robust and regulated platform to create a new global market for recruitment agencies and employers to trade directly with each other, thereby allowing them to benefit from the global demand and supply imbalance rather than struggle with it, as is currently the case.
The exchange connects recruitment professionals and employers from around the world on a single trading access point, creating an exclusive and enclosed market for Intalex members to trade their candidates and jobs directly.
We believe our platform will change the face of how companies recruit talent from both a cost and time perspective.
Intalex shrinks the globe, country and individual city markets and enables the smallest agency to compete with the largest agent, for mutual benefit and transaction success. Conversely, the Intalex platform also helps large, global employers with niche aggregated talent supply chain of global and specialist recruiters. Not only will the employer have access to the world’s best talent, they will also benefit from paying less for that talent through our unique reverse auction facility. For employers, Intalex seeks to disrupt the current cost model of recruitment by inverting it, putting the pricing control back into their hands.
Intalex is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, which is regarded as Europe’s technology hub, with a further sales and marketing office in San Francisco. 

Given Ireland’s proximity to both Europe and the USA, we believe we are ideally positioned to serve these markets. Intalex was founded by two successful technology and recruitment entrepreneurs, Ray Nolan and Jason Kennedy, who have an impressive track record of creating technology solutions which drive cost and other significant efficiencies in large global markets."

"Idro Meccanica compressors are hydraulically driven. The oil and the gas sections are separated by a short single-compartment distance piece vented to the atmosphere. The vent lines for oil and gas could be collected and checked from time to time to control the status of the seals. The gas section is non-lubricated and due to the separation and the double seals, the oil carry-over is virtually none.

The flexibility of the hydraulic system helps in having compressors and boosters that could accept a wide range of inlet pressures. Some of our units could also be used as compressor/boosters to fill and then intake gas from a high-pressure storage in order to achieve high flow-rate in a direct fill.

The booster compressor is also the most suitable solution for daughter refueling stations as they do not need to reduce the pressure from the mobile storages being able to accept a wide inlet pressure range.

Idro Meccanica compressors could have a maximum of five stages in one cylinder. The best-sold models are two and three stage compressors/boosters.

Most of the units could also be supplied in twin version with two compressors assembled on the same frame in order to reduce installation space. The twin solution could also be used with two different models in order to combine a booster with a low-pressure compressor.

The selection of the correct model is usually carried-out together with the potential customer taking into consideration the type of gas, available inlet pressure, required outlet pressure and rate of flow.

Most of the units could be tailored to the customers’ needs with just small modifications from our main PED certified standard models (more than 50)."

"The parent company Ferrovie dello Stato SpA is 100% owned by the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance, and controls the operating companies in the four industrial sectors: transport, infrastructure, real estate services and other services. All the companies nevertheless maintain their own company characteristics and are run autonomously in pursuing their respective business objectives.

Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, while leaving the autonomous legal responsibilities of the companies in which it holds shares unchanged, mainly carries out company type activity which is typical of a holding company (management of the subsidiaries, share ownership, etc..), as well as industrial type work. Through a system of Central Directorates, the parent company also sets strategic approaches and ensures the orientation and the coordination of the industrial policies of the operational companies.

The election recognises the commitment of the group in developing the railway sector and the ability to best represent its interests. It also means an important milestone for the Italian system, which will have the chance to influence the creation of transport policies at a global level, in one of the most strategic industries for investment and in terms of the impact it has on people and a country's economy. The UIC will also be called upon to play the vital role of consultant and advisor for the large investment programmes which are currently under way, or are scheduled for the next few years around the world: from the TEN-T European corridors (passengers and freight) to China, the US, India and Russia.

Another important stage in the renewal process has been the introduction of the new Busitalia Fast service, which was presented in April in Berlin on the occasion of the sector's international trade fair Bus2Bus 2017.

Created with the aim of becoming the main European player in long-distance mobility by bus, the service runs daily service to 15 Italian regions and over 90 cities in Italy and Germany, with a fleet of 60 latest-generation buses.

And then during 2017, the FS Italiane group's rail freight transport and logistics services changed radically with the launch of the Polo Mercitalia, a single, large hub that brings together the group companies that operate in this area (Mercitalia Logistics, Mercitalia Rail, Gruppo TX Logistik, Mercitalia Intermodal, Mercitalia Transport & Services, Mercitalia Shunting & Terminal, TerAlp and TLF).

"Spedingo.com is the Italian eco-friendly delivery marketplace.

Launched in 2012, the service matches people needing to move goods with transport and moving companies ""going there anyway"".

The marketplace allows consumers and businesses to save up to 70% on deliveries of large boxes, household goods, cars, bikes, palletised industrial goods and any other large item.

The idea underlying Spedingo’s success is simple: over 25% of lorries run completely empty of cargo and over 50% run only part-full. By matching demand with supply we allow to make use of this spare capacity, thus helping transport providers to generate extra profits as well as customers to benefit from huge price discounts.

Last but not least, Spedingo contributes day by day to the reduction of the number of vehicles on the roads, thus avoiding the associated CO2 emissions."

"The first boxes of fruit and vegetables delivered from myfarmfreshbox were dispatched in September 2016. Since that first delivery the growth of the company has led to a move from the garden to the 30,000 sq.ft. warehouse in Maidenhead, out of which the company operates today. When it started out myfarmfreshbox was a one-man operation delivering ten boxes of fruit and vegetables a week. Today the company has fourteen employees and delivers some 750 boxes weekly, adding up to an impressive total of 40,000 boxes of fresh produce delivered annually. As well as growing in size, myfarmfreshbox has also diversified its offering, and in addition to the traditional fruit and vegetables that it offered at the outset, the company now offers home-made soups and pies, dairy products, bread, fruit juices, cakes, and free range eggs and meat, the latter delivered in special chilled packaging to ensure that it keeps chilled and fresh. Myfarmfreshbox is committed to providing its customers with a broad range of fresh, quality produce at good value for their money and with a reasonable shelf life.
Myfarmfreshbox services a catchment area that extends from London to Maidenhead, and includes several points in between. Deliveries are made overnight, with a guarantee of the boxes arriving by 4 a.m., meaning that people who are out at work all day can bring the fresh produce in before leaving in the morning or setting off on car pools to school, and come home to a kitchen well-stocked with fresh produce, all without having to actually go to the shops. The downside of this overnight delivery is that people is blocks of flats with security doors may not be able to enjoy the service if the company cannot access the building during the night.
The fruit and vegetables offered by myfarmfreshbox.co.uk are locally grown, fresh produce, but not organic, although general local farmers do tend to keep their use of chemicals down to a minimum. This preference for local fresh over organic stems from a number of basic reasons – the desire to create sustainable, local agriculture; organic produce is often not available locally and is brought in from further away, meaning may “food miles” are traveled and the produce is less fresh; costs are reduced as the middleman is eliminated when myfarmfreshbox buys directly from the local farmers, and this cost reduction is passed on to the customers. 
Becoming a myfarmfreshbox.co.uk customer is quick and simple, and is done online on the company’s attractive, user-friendly site. The first step is entering your postcode to see what can be delivered to your area, and unchecking produce that you do not want to receive. On this page the customer can also add eggs for weekly or fortnightly delivery, as well as potatoes for monthly delivery. The next steps allow the customer to select from the range of additional products offered by myfarmfreshbox. After selection of all products, the customer is required to enter the delivery address and pay the £2 delivery charge using the company’s secure server."

"CORE-POWER is developing game changing energy technology for ocean transportation together with the world’s leading Advanced Reactor Developers (ARDs). The world’s leading ARDs have chosen to partner with CORE-POWER because we bring access to pent-up demand from a market with real customers.


The marine-Molten Salt Reactor (m-MSR) is set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040.

The m-MSR is the technology that forms the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions. 

Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 197 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard.

The m-MSR is like an atomic battery pack. The m-MSR is small, with no moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel.

The m-MSR is inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. In an m-MSR the fuel is the coolant, and the coolant is the fuel, so coolant cannot be lost. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion.

The m-MSR has an economic potential which is greater than that of oil and gas. It can provide all the sustainable, clean energy we need to move us deep into the future without polluting the environment."

"24 Hour Alcohol offers UK consumers the opportunity to buy alcoholic beverages through the night, with the option of either on-demand home delivery or collection from a nearby 24hr off licence. The chance for retailers to sell beer, wine and spirits all night is possible due to the Licensing Act 2003, the so called 24 hour drinking law introduced in 2005, which enables establishments to apply for a licence to sell alcohol 24hrs a day, 7 days a week. Even more than a decade after the relaxation of times alcohol can be sold, it's still not always easy for the consumer to locate late night drinks. To solve this problem, the 24 Hour Alcohol database of 24 hour off licences includes all such premises in England & Wales, from large Tesco and Asda superstores to small independent supermarkets and petrol stations. 24 hour drinking does not apply in Scotland or Northern Ireland, where different licensing regulations apply. Sometimes it's not possible for consumers to visit a local store, which is where an alcohol delivery service is invaluable. Drinks are delivered at speed straight to the consumers door, with deliveries usually completed within a very short space of time, usually just a matter of minutes. A range of drinks are available: beers, wines, spirits, ales, ciders, champagne, alcopops, mixers and soft drinks, plus extras like cigarettes, snacks and takeaway food."

"Delivery Club is a user-friendly technology platform. It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders. 

One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied.

Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries.

One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient.

The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution.

With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.

Overall, food delivery businesses should run more efficiently, ultimately improving their profitability.

Delivery Club intends to disrupt the food delivery market."

"Increasing urbanisation is posing significant problems to many of the worlds cities, especially the very largest megacities whose infrastructure cannot cope with the demand for transport by millions of users daily.
A Transit Exchange is a means to rationalise contended access to any “transportspace” (roadspace, waterway or airspace system) based on the construct of a commodity futures exchange. Most simply it enables real-time, dynamic ridesharing on a very large scale in any type of vehicle which carries passengers or freight.
Using mathematical optimisation techniques (based on heuristics and genetic algorithms) the Transit Exchange examines and aggregates origin-destination requests for transport from dispersed users in both space and time (who may or may not know one another) and applies operational concepts and knowhow garnered from successful prior deployments, Texxi provides a relevant trip package suggestions for ridesharing to those users and the vehicle operators in the locality.
The Transit Exchange also generates income for municipal road operators from the very market making functions used to fill the empty seats in the fleet or vehicles operated in the “transportspace”. Now congestion pricing, road pricing and vehicle pricing charges can all be applied to users and a negative congestion charge implemented so as to not adversely affect the poorest in society.
Predictive Analytics permit the transport users to choose when to travel and the transport service providers to place their assets in the most logical positions to best serve demand.
If an investor was to deploy an amount of money into the Transit Exchange, then through the market making protocols in solving NP-hard problems related to Large Scale Dynamic Real-time Ridesharing a set of returns with varying yield-to-maturities can be replicated, providing an alternative to money-market funds and instantiated through the mechanism of a blockchain coin offering.
Rather than relying on the rather nebulous promise of perpetual cryptographic security of a blockchain ledger, the provable work done has solved a pressing and current problem in the real world and done so in a manner that was transparent.
High Liquidity investable security instruments (Transit Exchange Bill or TE-Bills) can thus be made available via the Transit Exchange. Its original purpose. To store value represented by demand for travel in a locality.
Hence we will have a computational-crypto-currency backed by a commodity called “transport demand”.
From 1968 - 2010, many academics in many of the top Universities in the world said that dynamic, real-time, ridesharing was not yet possible. Texxi proved it was possible in 2006 and in 2008, using the idea of a futures exchange, a dynamic social network map and genetic algorithms to solve an otherwise intractable solution.

Their  ‘Classic’ range continues to be their flagship vehicle – with models including the 4/4, the world’s longest-running production vehicle, and engine sizes ranging from 1600cc to 4800cc, these famous icons are the models perhaps most associated with Morgan."

In addition, the app has a panic button and live tracking and also automatic confirmation alerts. What this means is once a booking is confirmed you receive full driver and vehicle details. But if your car is to arrive at 7pm and the journey is 15 minutes then you get an alert checking if you have got in the car at 7pm and then another one at 7.15pm checking to see if you have arrived at your destination.

We get consumers the cheapest fares from licensed minicab companies because each minicab company bids for a job and within 70 seconds. A recent example was a price bidding started at £28 then £24 and then the last price was £18, this gave a saving of £10 to the customer.

Our aim is to reduce crime and promote safety and we have setup Safer Minicabs with this in mind and because of the 233 cab related sexual offences reported by Metropolitan Police between 2009-2010.

We have won various awards and have been supported by many corporate partners.

"In 1988 Steve Bushell recognised a need in the Commercial Vehicle Industry for larger and specialised fuel tanks, so with a workforce of only three based in a two bay workshop, SB Components was formed.

The 1990’s was a period of expansion and by year 2000 revenues had grown to £2.5 million. A significant investment was made in Millennium Works, a purpose built premises of 30,000 square feet to accommodate the growing business.

In 2007 Truck Logic was acquired and fully integrated within our existing operation and facilities, bringing the total workforce to over seventy with a turnover of £7 million.

With an increase in demand from customers outside of the UK a new partnership started with Dutch colleagues and in 2009 a joint operation called SB Europe was created in Holland. SB Europe continues to grow with markets in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Holland.

As the company’s reputation for quality and service continued to grow within the Commercial Vehicle Industry, and with an ever increasing customer base, the management team took a decision to break into a whole new sector and in 2011 a further building and new workforce were put in place to create a fully dedicated production space for high quality and durable bodies for the 3.5T to 26T market. This increased production capacity to 43,000 square feet with a workforce of a hundred people and a turnover of £10 million.

With high profile customers such as John Lewis, DHL, Tesco, SIG and TNT, new premises were leased in 2014 to form a dedicated Fleet Application Centre. This added an additional 6,000 square feet of capacity specifically for fleet work.

In November 2014 we completed a six bay 5000 square feet workshop extension to our existing main site which included a single axle digital weighbridge to accommodate new European Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA) legislation which was recently introduced within the Commercial Vehicle Industry. We are proud to say that with a vast amount of dedication and further investment we continue to offer our customers a product range that now meets type approval legislation, including all of our body conversions from 3.5T to 26T.

With a total production capacity of over 60,000 square feet across three sites, a workforce of around 130 people, and an annual turnover of £15 million the company has continued to grow successfully into one of the leading businesses of its kind in the UK and with a committed and dynamic team we plan for an exciting and positive future for both ourselves and our customers."

In late 2016, the company launched a world first airline integrated home bag check-in and delivery service with British Airways. 

The digital service moved the bag drop desk online and has done away with traditional check-in at the airport. Having booked via a partner airline channel, it allows air passengers to check-in their bags with a vetted delivery driver, powered by AirPortr's technology. Leaving passengers free to travel to, and through, the airport at their leisure – only needing to collect their bags from baggage reclaim when they land. 

The product delivers operating benefits to airlines and airports, introducing baggage to the system early, reducing queues at peak times, and enabling bags to bypass expensive to operate landside terminal areas.

"Transship is an automated freight forwarding platform that will disrupt the international shipping of perishable goods industry. Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high.

Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via EDI/API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers. 

Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device provided by Sensor Transport. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site. 

Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world.

Transship will do to international shipments of perishable goods what Fed Ex and UPS did to parcel shipments; more efficient, more accessible and more cost effective.

Transship is currently seeking $1 in seed funding."

Panjiva hosts a database of information on over 700,000 suppliers, including recent shipments, customer lists, credit reports, certification details, and denied parties lists. It claims to be the first and only online information source designed to provide complete transparency into overseas suppliers. According Jeff Silberman, chair of the department of textile development and marketing at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology ""Panjiva is not just innovative, it's revolutionary""[1]

By collecting market data from suppliers, Panjiva is also able to produce details of trends within sectors. Information published by Panjiva has been used by news websites such as FT.com[2] and CNNMoney.com[3].

Founding

Josh Green was working at an electronics company in Summer of 2005 when he was asked to find a replacement for one of the company's existing suppliers. ""Naively, I thought this would be easy""? said Panjiva co-founder Green, ""but I soon discovered two things. First, that there is no shortage of information about companies on the web. And second, that almost none of it is either objective or useful in identifying trustworthy suppliers. When I talked the problem over with my MIT friend Jim Psota, Panjiva was born.""

Naming

"Quickly create private communities of customers, riders or drivers of your choosing and start offering rides.

With RideConnect, you can schedule your rides, or order a car from a simple interface.

RideConnect is a ridesharing platform. Casual and commercial drivers can offer transportation directly to their riders through RideConnect, thereby keeping what money they make.

With RideConnect, people in cities, towns or any other type of community can organize their own rideshare even where other car service options don't exist.

Features

RideBoard

A centralized scheduler for rides. Riders can schedule their rides with their preferred drivers up to 24 hrs in advance. Drivers can announce their trips so that riders can ask for a ride.

My Community

A dynamic list of riders and drivers sourced from your private contacts. You control who's in and who's out. You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community.

RideMode

See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie.

Best Practices

Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook. You can also block people within the My Community screen in RideConnect and this will prevent them from sharing rides with you but will not remove them from your community. Be safe. Drive safe. Ride safe.


That's it. Start sharing rides."

The company currently has the operational capacity to mine about eight million tons of coal per year from more than 300 million tons of recoverable reserves."
"Long before they (The Johnson Brothers) were building mining equipment for coal miners, they were digging coal with fellow coal miners. What better credentials would a manufacturer of mining equipment need? In other words, they have ""been there and done that."" They understand the inner workings of mining equipment first hand because they have ""hands on"" experience that some manufacturers may lack. That speaks well for  the quality of equipment Johnson Industries manufactures and explains the unsullied reputation they have earned over the years.

Johnson Brothers Coal Company was established in 1974 by five Johnson brothers - Greg, Garla, Gwendel, Garnie, and George, all coming from different walks of life, but all with an innate ability to think and create. Their ability to design innovative solutions to the challenges they faced on the job paid off. The Kinney Branch Company that Garnie supervised became the highest ton per man hour coal producer in the United States. A  back injury shortened George's coal mining life, but maybe it was a ""blessing in disguise,"" because after that he devoted his time to design and production.

In 1981, they established Johnson Industries and immediately started manufacturing the industrial duty car, followed by the Super Low Tail Piece. A patented laser alignment tool for the underground mining industry (Slimm-Jim Laser) was developed next and it quickly gained industry acceptance. Johnson Industries' next proud accomplishment was the Stinger - an MSHA permissible and explosion proof personnel carrier that became a top seller in the industry. One rugged product after another has emerged from Johnson Industries, with each piece proving increased efficiency and improved safety."

"For more than 30 years, NRI has focused its strategic research initiatives on the development, manufacturing, and marketing of state-of-the-art pipe repair solutions that withstand the tests of time, water, and other elements. The company’s Syntho-Glass® system has proven to be reliable enough for the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard, and international natural gas and oil industry conglomerates to require Syntho-Glass® availability for all pipe repairs.

Founded in 1982, NRI developed its pipe repair systems for application within the marine industry. As the original inventors of the moisture-cured, pre-impregnated composite material, NRI caught the attention of the U.S. Navy and, in 1996, secured its first contract with the U.S. government requiring NRI’s Syntho-Glass® system to be carried aboard all Navy vessels.

The company’s success with the U.S. Navy led to the creation of larger and more robust materials. This expansion of its product capabilities allowed for the exploration of opportunities within the natural gas and oil industries. NRI focused on further developing its original product to specifically address the pipe repair and reinforcement challenges within those unique industries.

With its focus on development, NRI experienced substantial success and growth, requiring a move to a new facility in 2009. Since that time, the company has tripled in size and revenues as the demand for its solutions continues to grow. To support this demand, NRI has introduced an average of one new product per year over the last four years, with each product focusing on the company’s participation in the evolution of leak repair and pipe reinforcement."

"Let me share with you a well-kept secret: FedEx does not own the FedEx truck that delivers packages to your home.  Here is another one: FedEx does not employ the driver of that truck.  FedEx subcontracts with companies like ours to deliver packages to people’s homes.  Companies like ours are the ones that buy the trucks and hire the drivers to deliver the packages.  “Okay, but what does that mean to me?” you are probably wondering. 

District Delivery is an independent contractor that has an agreement to deliver packages for FedEx Home Delivery for certain routes in the Greater Washington, DC metropolitan area, specifically including the near Virginia suburbs including, Alexandria, Va. We employ 14 drivers and have 14 trucks. In the off-peak season we deliver approximately 7500 per week. In peak season volume increases by approximately 200 - 300% and we will employ 24 drivers and will have 24 trucks. Like other multiple route owners, we are eligible for certain monthly and quarterly bonuses which can add as much as 15 - 20 % to our income.

We have two main ways to expand our business and increase our revenue – maintaining an excellent record of timely and safe delivery of packages and acquiring additional routes.  In our business, we are rated by FedEx on our ability to deliver packages in a timely, effective and safe manner.  If we are successful in doing so, we will be eligible for certain monthly and quarterly bonuses.  In the aggregate, those bonuses can be significant.  In addition, maintaining a timely, effective and safe delivery record puts us in a position to acquire additional delivery routes, if and when they become available. 

Currently, we are seeking investment capital in order to acquire additional routes that are, or soon will be, available."

Metcash’s customers are, predominantly, independently owned grocery and liquor stores, but also include hardware stores, which operate under our portfolio of brands including: IGA, Mitre 10, and Cellarbrations. 

Metcash champions the interests of the independent grocery, liquor and hardware sectors through its core competencies of buying, merchandising, marketing, brand building, distribution logistics and warehousing. 

Metcash Food and Grocery (MF&G) is the wholesale dry grocery and fresh foods pillar of the business; supplying product for our brands and distributors along with support for ranging, retail operations, merchandising and marketing. The business is supported by 5 major distribution centres delivering dry, chilled, frozen, general merchandise and hair/beauty/cosmetics. Eight fresh distribution centres deliver fresh produce, meat, bakery and deli products. 

For a large part of its history, Metcash carried the name of the founder of its predecessor business, Davids. 

Founder Joe David, was the second son of Lebanese migrants; a visionary and entrepreneurial thinker. In May 1927, at the age of 24, he opened his first ‘food’ store at Woolloomooloo, NSW; closely followed by six others. As the businesses prospered, Davids continued to expand and in 1935 opened a wholesale warehouse in Surry Hills, NSW. 

The Davids business identified a niche market with great opportunity; supporting and wholesaling to independent retailers. The company formed the first professionally organised voluntary retail group in NSW and also established the industry’s first Retail Services Program for independent retailers. In 1980 the company acquired AG Campbells wholesale business."

"Raspberry Express is an express carpooling service provider.

Raspberry Express is the world leader in development of express carpooling systems.  In addition to providing express carpooling services, Raspberry Express can assist with the analysis and marketing necessary for establishing express carpooling routes.

Express carpooling is meeting-place based carpooling, in which participants make their way (walk, cycle, scooter, drive) to a meeting-place, and form fuller cars in the order of their arrival.  Each meeting-place is specific to one destination.  There are three types of participants:  those who always want to drive; those who always want to ride; and those who will do whichever works best for them on the day.  There is no trip-by-trip pre-arrangement of who will ride with whom.  The return journey might be by similar express carpool, or by public transport.  Three and four-person carpools are as easy to form as two-person ones.  Participants can make their final decision to ride or drive right up until the last moment.

Express carpooling is best understood by reference to the 'slug lines' in Washington DC, and the 'casual carpooling' in San Francisco.  These systems developed organically over many years.

Raspberry Express seeks to catalyse new express carpooling routes and so achieve the benefit of this approach to carpool formation for additional cities."

"Wairon is the first Brazilian startup to work with the concept of shared economics applied to laundry.

 In this way, the business model is able to optimize people's time because it promotes meeting the demand with the service: customers with laundries or washers.

Wairon plays the role of mediating the dialogue between the customer and the supplier, ensuring intelligent order logistics.

The system is simple:

Client: Anyone who needs clean clothes and/or ironing, but does not have a washing machine at home, or time/money to use a nearby laundry room. They register on Wairon's website as customers, and through the Control Panel request and follow-up - washing, washing and ironing, ironing - and scheduling day/time to deliver and receive their clothes.

Laundries: accredited establishments that use their equipment structure, employees and logistics to wash more specific clothes.

Washer: people able to provide this type of service, at home, in their free time. They seek a complementary income and already have a structure composed of a washing machine and an iron (dryer is optional).

This process has a lower cost than a laundry because it utilizes the idleness of the laundries or the physical space and resources that each Washer has in your home.

Both laundries and washers are responsible for the collection and delivery of clothes.

The quality of the relationships, as well as the quality of the service of the supplier, will always be analyzed by the feedbacks."
