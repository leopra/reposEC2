"CarbonCure Technologies creates, develops, and licenses solutions that consume waste CO2 to make better concrete. It spurs the market shift towards affordable green concrete, by enabling concrete manufacturers to convert waste CO2 into solid minerals, locked away as a solid within concrete during manufacturing. It is a green building technology company currently serving concrete product manufacturers in the US and Canada. It offers concrete producers the ability to manufacture green concrete products without compromising on either quality or price.

CarbonCure is a retrofit innovation that repurposes CO2 gas from large final emitters as a feedstock in concrete plants. The gas is permanently converted into embedded solid mineral carbonates that yield material, environmental, and production advantages. By enabling concrete manufacturers to consume CO2 into concrete products during manufacturing, the technology differentiates an otherwise traditional commodity concrete product, while achieving superior material performance characteristics. In addition to technology, CarbonCure provides demand-pull marketing and environmental reporting/certification services to reinforce its customers’ exclusive competitive positioning. The technology is licensed at a very low-CAPEX to concrete producers, generating a recurring revenue stream.

CarbonCure Technologies was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia."

"FastBuild is a construction system that allows buildings to be constructed faster at a lower cost and with higher quality than traditional systems.  It is ideally suited for villa construction and high rise buildings.  There are two manufactured components: lightweight concrete blocks and pre-stressed t-beams.   We have invested in equipment, licenses and inventory and are seeking additional capital of $800,000 to establish a commercial scale factory in the Gulf region that will produce two villas per week.  

There is overwhelming demand for the our products in the Gulf region, and to secure a portion of this we need to expand production capacity and add equipment to upgrade from the pilot scale mobile factory we already own to a fully functioning factory.  

Investors capital can be fully repaid from a project of only 50 villas, or only six months of production.  To enable installation of our system, we have partnered with a 600+ person, Canadian owned construction company that is able to execute projects of any size.  

Quality labour supply is a key issue in the Gulf construction industry.  Labour productivity is significantly higher with FastBuild so total labour requirements can be 60% less.   Speed of construction is a primary selling feature of the FastBuild system.  Whereas a project of 30 villas may take 18 months to complete, the same project with FastBuild could be completed in 12 months.  This represents a tremendous savings in overhead and dramatically improves return on invested capital.   FastBuild blocks can be used for partition walls, and in this case the savings are excellent => 17-24%.   Pre-stressed t-beams generate a savings of 20% in direct costs and are much faster to built floors with than casting a concrete slab."

"The concept of RENOMii started with Scott Barker who worked to help homeowners find quality renovation contractors. Scott managed projects from start to finish by facilitating communication and fair practice between contractors and homeowners. It wasn’t long before he became a mediator – always making sure what was agreed upon was what got done.

Scott realized the industry was missing a simple, easy-to-use tool that could eliminate most of the stress caused by communication errors. Most of the software available was complicated and feature heavy, taking too long to learn. This market opportunity led to the creation of RENOMii – a simple to use, yet effective application that tracks contract changes throughout a project.

 Scott and Kara, the RENOMii co-founders quickly got to work joining the Accelerator Program in Waterloo, Ontario. From there, they were accepted into the three month Hyperdrive sprint program. Since then they have been working hard speaking with contractors, homeowners and industry experts in order to develop the RENOMii software and address the needs of its users.

RENOMii was designed by contractors for contractors. We will continue to strive to improve RENOMii while keeping the contractors’ daily work in mind.We are proud of our amazing team and continue to focus on recruiting the best and brightest development, support and design superstars."

"Bedrock Construction is one of Calgary's leading small businesses specializing in residential and commercial construction since 1991. Through the founder & CEO, Corrie Massie's reputation and experience, Bedrock has successfully become a booming company that was built from the ground up. With a healthy dose of discipline and dedication, Bedrock has the capacity to manage all small to large scale projects, both residential and commercial, while maintaining an A+ BBB rating.

Deeply Rooted in Calgary
Bedrock's first project back in 1991 was a marble tile job down in Inglewood. Corrie Massie was the sole employee and stone mason of Bedrock Construction at that time.

The marble was salvaged from the Royal Bank Bankers Hall the year prior and stored at Corrie's father's farm. The individual pieces were all hand cut on the street right in front of the store.  The marble was installed using an old technique using copper wire and plaster of paris.

This building is still standing today.

Corrie Massie is the face of Bedrock Construction and has over 35 years’ experience in the construction and renovation industry. He began his career as a tile setter, laying some of Calgary’s largest stone slabs downtown. His meticulous eye for detail and love of the trade fostered a reputation as one of Calgary’s top tile setters and mentors. Some of his greatest successes are with the people he trained and mentored.

How did Bedrock Construction come to be?
Corrie’s excitement for the industry grew into a need to be a part of something bigger. Bedrock Construction was born in 1991, out of his desire to impact families and companies on a larger scale. Bit by bit or tile-by-tile, he could help turn dreams into realities."

"3 pivots. Bootstrapped. Social Enterprise [US-equiv: B-Corp]. Startup aiming to remanufacture shipping containers into apartment blocks. Targeting mixed market and low-income housing rates to address Vancouver, Canada's extreme lack of affordable housing, whilst creating skilled trades training for the homeless population needing the work. First profitable mixed-rate model for a remanufacturable ""modular container apartment"" system. Restarted and ended in 2007/08. Blocked by the powers that be. Starting 1 year before The Netherlands' tempohousing who were also blocked from entering BC market [heard the backstory]. A decade before BC Hydro’s Olympics' showcase; 15 years before the Atira project; 18 years before Mayor Robertson's claims; years before NY Mayor Bloomberg's 2013 claim to have introduced the first system in the world. Many social agencies would not help, including those that claim to want to help solve affordable housing issues. My conclusion, in part, is that social agencies sometimes profit from homelessness, and sometimes exist to be cultivating farms for proto-electables. 

My learning: political types sometimes willingly help others profit from the vulnerable. In Canada, social enterprises are often in danger of becoming political enterprises, controlled for personal political ambition. Projects get stuck in political time, entrepreneurs need political approval to move forward, project politicization prevents the civil service from doing its' job--nurturing sustainable systems for today and future generations--and this takes precedence over addressing the social problem with new solutions. The Lesson: To change the world quickly and positively, bring great products and services to your customers with enterprising non-profits and private enterprise. In Canada, when starting stay as quiet as a mouse.

"Since 1986 Fab-Form has invented, developed and commercialized foundation products that are greener and more sustainable for the building industry. Each product is cost effective and uses less embodied energy in their production.

In 1986, Fab-Form developed the fabric-based Fastfoot footing form, which replaced bulky dimensional lumber with light weight polyethylene.
In 1999 Fab-Form developed the fabric-based Fastbag, which was used to seismically upgrade schools and homes damaged after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California.
In 2002, Fab-Form introduced the fabric-based Fast-Tube, the world's first column form manufactured entirely of a lightweight polyethylene fabric. Placing 100' of column form behind the contractor's seat was revolutionary.
In 2010, Fab-Form introduced the Zont bracing system for insulated concrete forms. Traditional ICF braces are heavy and cumberson - the Zont brace weigh and costs about 10% of conventional.
In 2011, Fab-Form introduced the ICF Monopour System for insulated concrete forms. This product made ICFs far more sustainable and economic as a single concrete pour could complete the footing and foundation wall.
In 2017, Fab-Form is introducing three new products:
ZAT catwalk braket: an accessory to the Zont bracing system, this simplifies the construction of the walkway for foundations;
Fast-Tube improved:  the fabric is woven specifically for the Fast-Tube: less stretching, stronger and clear (so that the filling of concrete can be seen) UPC labeling has been completed so that the product can be distributed to big box construction supply houses.
MP Manufacturing: the manufacturing of the ICF monopour system is being rationalized. Fab-Form intends to franchise this to truss manufacturers."

The ""Cube"" are real constructions using the latest construction techniques of contemporary houses. Wood has been selected as the noble material of our range. The great mechanical strength of the wood, combined with its lightness, have made it the material of choice used for centuries for the execution of the frames and centerpieces of all the houses. The proof of solidity is more to do. Wood in construction, allows more daring in architecture, more flexibility in volumes. The perfect preservation of the ancient half-timbered houses dating back several centuries, even poorly maintained, testifies. Today, the woods are treated and implemented according to strict standards. Sustainability is guaranteed, we can say that a timber frame house of our time is eternal."

"Concrete is the most widely used building material on our planet. The only thing mankind uses more of is water. With a wave of urban development coming in the next few decades, concrete is also a rapidly growing trillion-dollar market. However, cement and concrete production is responsible for 8% of the global CO2 emissions, making its growth a big cause for concern.

Low-carbon concrete exists - but until now it has been too sophisticated to be produced reliably and on a large scale. It contains very little burnt limestone - responsible for the strength of concrete and CO2 emissions. This makes low-carbon concrete vulnerable to fluctuations in raw materials and operating conditions and thus difficult to produce with reliable quality. Adding to the challenge: the final quality of concrete can only be measured weeks AFTER it has been processed on the construction site - far too late to be corrected. This is why our world is still built on more robust, high-carbon concrete. 

Using alcemy's software, cement and concrete producers receive precise quality predictions already during production. Based on these prediction models, our AI identifies which production parameters need to be adjusted to mitigate the impact of fluctuations. Thus, the quality of cement and concrete can be optimized BEFORE delivery – for the first time in history.

The result is significantly more consistent product quality, allowing producers to safely replace burnt limestone with less expensive, low-carbon materials found in nature. In this way, they can also avoid payments for CO2 emission certificates in the EU. 

Saving costs, bringing production processes up to speed for 21st century concrete recipes, and saving half of Europe’s CO2 emissions goes hand in hand at alcemy. Join us on our journey to make low-carbon concrete a reality!"

"The concept of digital twin is becoming more apparent in the construction industry. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, using real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. In terms of automated production and level of digitalization, the construction industry is still significantly behind other industries. Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions.

DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling). Tunnelware is a VaaS (Virtuality as a Service) for tunnel construction industry to manage the construction process while managing the data generated by various sensors and human interaction. With a focus on reducing cost and waste? and increasing productivity, our system will improve the construction process at every stage, delivering faster builds to a higher quality with fewer defects and more sustainable tunnels."

"PlanetReuse (PR) was founded on a simple, but revolutionary idea: make reclaimed building material reuse easier and more people will do it.   

PlanetReuse is a reclaimed materials consultancy and brokerage firm.  PR expertly matches reclaimed materials with designers, builders, and owners to save projects money, serve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) efforts and sustain the planet.  PR grew over 300% last year.  Having encouraged and coordinated the reuse of building materials for hundreds of commercial jobs, our work has made us a national leader in commercial green building.  

After spending the last four years building a reclaimed building materials network to serve the commercial building industry, PlanetReuse is now launching an effort to bring this monumental opportunity to every day citizens across the U.S.  Our aim is to make reclaimed building materials top-of-mind and easy-to-access so both commercial and residential building owners who need materials for a construction project, consider 'used' materials before 'new.’  And when it’s time for demolition or renovation we want reuse to be THE obvious alternative to the landfill.

To increase awareness of, and access to, reused/surplus residential building materials, we will soon introduce PlanetReuse Marketplace (PRM).  PRM will be a national, social media-enabled website that allows customers to locate, view, share and eventually buy inventory from the roughly 1,100 for-profit and non-profit reuse centers in the U.S.  (e.g. Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Chicago's Rebuilding Exchange) that sell used and surplus materials at 40-60% off the price of new.  Reuse centers will populate the site with their inventories via our proprietary technology, InvenQuery, which uses a mobile phone application to instantly -- and in a single work-flow -- post new inventory online upon intake and remove it at point-of-sale.   

The InvenQuery technology platform, which incorporates e-commerce and social media marketing, has been designed in collaboration with reuse centers nationwide and will fundamentally change the trajectory of reclaimed building material sales. 

The reuse center industry is growing 15-20% per year, yet straw polls suggest only 2 of 10 Americans are even aware of reuse centers.   Furthermore, they sell less than 5% of inventory online, using a clunky manual posting process for Craigslist or Facebook.  PRM, powered by InvenQuery will change this.  We will bring connection, convenience, awareness and credibility to the reuse industry, ultimately making it as easy to shop online for reclaimed building materials as it is to shop for new materials from Home Depot or Lowe’s."

"D-ÉG Thermoset Kft. is a defining player in the building engineering market in Hungary. On the one hand, the company owns the widely recognized panel radiator factory in Dunaújváros, which represents top manufacturing quality in the region and is the only Hungarian-owned company operating in the field. On the other hand - based on its radiator production activities - the company has established a commercial retail chain of 23 stores located around the country. Today, the turnover of these stores is several times greater than D-ÉG Thermoset's turnover from the manufacturing and sale of radiators. 

During the recession in the construction sector after 2008, the company lost significant markets both in its commercial and in its manufacturing divisions. Its relative market share, however, did not decrease: in fact, D-ÉG Thermoset increased its presence in some segments. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the firm has implemented several important programs to improve efficiency. As a result, it was able to maintain operational profitability, even though lower turnover has led to proportionally increasing financial expenditures, necessitating the help of outside investors.

The common aim of both OTP Turnaround Capital Fund and the majority owner of D-ÉG Thermoset Kft. is to return the company to a path to growth. Since the medium-range prospects of Hungary's construction industry do not indicate any real market expansion, the business plan developed jointly focuses primarily on improving efficiency, entering new market segments while exploiting the company's current network, and increasing the export of radiators."

They are dedicated to enabling their clients to reduce project operating costs, enhance quality and optimise site performance, thus differentiating the services that they provide from those offered by their competitors.

Historically, the construction sector has been slow to embrace IT solutions to aid engineers and management in the delivery of mechanical and electrical projects. At EIDA Solutions they believe that this is due to traditional software applications being focused on IT capabilities rather than delivering systems which meet the needs of construction engineering professionals. They have addressed this shortfall by developing a software product which uses technology to accelerate and simplify the delivery of complex construction projects. EIDA Solutions in-built construction processes, used in a collaborative way by all users results in a higher quality of project outputs. This is proven in all their projects to date and their iterative approach to improving these many processes aligns itself with the paradigm of Lean Construction.

EIDA Solutions is an innovation driven organisation. They firmly believe that an ongoing process of research and development will allow us to provide their clients with new ways to maximise productivity, quality and return on investment. 

The use of BIM (Building Information Modelling) is gathering pace and revolutionising the way construction projects are being executed.

"GAMMA AR provides an augmented reality based construction management software that assists construction site managers and craftsman by intuitively overlaying 3D BIM Models accurately on the site, resulting in reduced errors, as well as speedy and unambiguous communication and progress monitoring, ultimately saving time and money. 
The application uses the data contained in Building Information Models (BIM) to overlay the worksite using augmented reality using mobile devices. 
This allows different stakeholders involved in the building process such as construction site managers and craftsmen to surveil and closely monitor the construction site as the construction progresses. Errors on the site (e.g. missing openings in walls for the piping) as well as errors in the 3D BIM model can easily be detected and prevented from happening at early stages of the building process. For this, GAMMA AR provides users the functionality to mark errors and make text/photo/voice annotations. These annotations are visible to all involved stakeholders in the app as well as in a central web service. This way the usual manual communication between different stakeholders that occurs at different stages of the construction process is automated and much more efficient.
Finding construction errors early is crucial, as costs and time to fix errors can drastically increase if the errors remain undetected, causing need for many expensive adjustments. 
GAMMA AR therefore yields in not only reduced construction costs but also time savings. Furthermore, GAMMA AR extends its usability even after construction has finished as it helps facility managers in maintaining buildings by providing visualization and communication infrastructure (e.g. visualize cables inside a wall for electricians).
Planners and Project Managers can access the data from GAMMA AR in realtime using the GAMMA BIM PORTAL. Here users can manage their projects, distribute files and manage tasks with assignments, due dates and revision states and connect with other solutions"

"Kvaerner is an international knowledge-based company. Kvaerner has decades of experience as an EPC contractor. Kvaerner is headquartered in Oslo, Norway, and has offices and fabrication facilities in several of the world’s main oil and gas regions. The Kvaerner brand is associated with some of the world’s most advanced technologies, providing our customers with maximum oil and gas production. 

At Kvaerner, their focus is on the fundamentals. Concern for health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) is essential for our activities. They see cost control and efficiency as key to successful project execution. At the same time, they know that quality and schedule have to be managed to achieve their ultimate goal: that every project is delivered predictably. 

Kvaerner delivers complete oil and gas offshore platforms and onshore process plants to operators and other customers. They specialise in executing engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects and are recognised as a world leader in delivering projects in challenging environments, with strict budget frames and within demanding schedules. Customers recognise Kvaerner as an expert in delivering cost-efficient project execution and effective oil and gas production facilities. 

Kvaerner has an organisation of 2 800 employees with expertise and experience covering all phases of a project’s life cycle. We also have the ability to call on a workforce of skilled personnel from strategic partners, subcontractors and suppliers, with whom we have well established relationships. 

Kvaerner has a long track record of enabling oil companies to realise some of the world’s most demanding and amazing projects. In doing so, they strive to add value to their customers and shareholders, as well as to the nations and local societies in which they operate. 

The companies brought together to create Kvaerner were established in the first half of the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution. These companies delivered products such as steam engines for rail and marine use and a range of industrial ironworks. 

Over the next 100 years, the businesses grew significantly. In the mid1900s, both Kvaerner and Aker were international corporations with activities in shipbuilding, hydro power, wood processing and other process operations, mechanical workshops and other industries. Through the 1970s, 80s and 90s, they developed their capabilities and experience as suppliers of complete solutions to offshore and onshore oil and gas and processing projects. They each grew – organically and through international acquisitions – to be leaders in their markets. 

In March 2002, the former Kvaerner group and the Aker Maritime group (comprising the oil and gas activities of the wider Aker group) were merged, and started to operate as one company under the name Kvaerner. In 2004, following a restructuring of both Aker and Kvaerner, Aker Kvaerner was established and the parent company of this group – Aker Kvaerner – was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Four years later, Aker Kvaerner changed its name to Aker Solutions. 

In December 2010, Aker Solutions announced a decision to cultivate its core businesses. Kvaerner was established, through a demerger, as a specialised EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) company addressing the global market. 

On 6 May 2011, the shareholders' annual general meeting approved the establishing of Kvaerner as a separate company."

"Construcciones Zorzano was originally founded in 1991 in La Rioja region of Spain. Since the very inception of the company, this family owned SME has set as their goal to find viable insulation methods for buildings. As such, their current portfolio of completed projects boasts lower energy consumption than the requirements by Spanish law, the company’s mission is set on becoming a fully near zero energy buildings developer as soon as financially possible. Over 400 housing and commercial units with a total value of over 15€ million have been developed with passive insulation techniques imbedded in them by the company in the northern region of Spain. INSUPanel consists of self-supporting, non-structural, adjoining panels that float and allow space to set an uninterrupted, thermal-bridge free, building envelope. The panels hover around leaving a single continuous volume around the building. This increases the thermal resistance of the house as a single system by effectively eliminating all thermal bridges; the result is insulation four times as effective at lower costs. INSUPanel constitutes a major breakthrough component inside the construction technology required to reach high levels of insulation. It solves the problem of competing methods that fail to achieve enough insulation without significant costs added. This construction process will drop energy requirements by up to 90% meaning direct savings of 2,558€ annually for each housing unit across Europe. It goes in line with Euopean Directives (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive)."
"CHECKTOBUILD is born because of the necessities that the construction sector presents nowadays. Considering only construction megaprojects, this sector is moving around 7 trillion $ a year. And following their previsions, megaprojects are going to grow a 109% in the next 10 years. 
It is extremely huge. So, it is absolutely incoherent that 1200 construction workers die a year only in the Qatar market. It is threatening that construction supervisor is the #9 most dangerous job in the world. And also, it does not make sense that with this giant market, almost the 98% of the megaprojects in the world finish their tasks overbudget and overtime nowadays.

To help construction projects, their designing and planification are increasing the adoption of the BIM methodology. The Building Information Modeling is revolutionizing the construction sector and it is planned to be used in the 98% of the megaprojects in the next 5 years.

So CHECKTOBUILD is born based in two fundamental pillars: These necessities that we have explained and the big opportunity that BIM represents.

CHECKTOBUILD is a construtech startup that provides an autonomous inspection service and business intelligence for big construction projects. We do it integrating BIM models, that the construction companies must develop, with IoT and drone`s sytems by a software platform.

In four simple steps, CHECKTOBUILD workflow is:
-	You upload the BIM model to the software platform.
-	Drones take photos of the construction execution step by step and send them to the platform.
-	The software platform creates an equivalent and real model to BIM with the drone’s photos and it compares them.
-	You receive a complete documentation, business intelligence and alerts about the progress of the construction and the supervision results.

We are focused in reducing wasted material, increasing inspection cost/time saving, reducing accidents in inspection services, provoking early error detection and creating a useful amount of real time data and new business intelligence.

It is time to help the construction sector to grow in the terms of its importance in this 21st century market. We know the way and we can contribute to it."

As rough data, the panels will cost around 120-140 € per square meter, and the annual rent of a 1 m2 of billboard is 250 €, or 700 € if it is a bus shelter. That's depends on the country and other factors.

This techology also includes transparent walls of high thermal insulation, better than 0.5 W/m2 / º K, which also allow greater passage of light and radiation in winter than in summer.

Videos with detail info is in our website www.alcresolar.com and we look for seed capital to extend the patent to some important countries, complete prototipes and to look for alliances and licencing."

"Branäsgruppen is a ski resort operator.

n the early 1960s, ideas were raised on a ski slope in Branäs. The then Finnskoga-Dalby municipality received a promise from Prime Minister Tage Erlander of a million SEK in support. This provided that any person in charge would take care of the project. At that time, however, no one was willing to be responsible for the construction of a ski slope in Branäs.

It was only in the mid-1980s that the project got a real boost. LO-Värmland took over the Branä project, and together with HSB Värmland and the county council in Värmland managed to finance. In July 1987, the message was given that the Branä project would receive state aid. In 1988 the spade was put into the ground and the inauguration of the plant was made by King Carl XVI Gustaf in December of the same year.

Over 500 million kronor were invested in the first few years, after which it became more difficult as costs went off and bankruptcy was close. In 1992 an agreement was made with creditors and the debts were written down by 75%. HSB Sweden took over the plant and operated it until 1999. After that, the current owners took over Branäs Fritidscenter AB and since 2004 belonged to Kungsberg's ski resort in the Branä Group.

"Ufloor Technologies is a floor insulation company that delivers warmer, more comfortable homes with minimal disruption. Residents also benefit from reduced heating bills and improved thermal comfort.

Ufloor prevents installers or homeowners from having to lift up any floor boards, or having to squeeze themselves in hazardous confined spaces (e..g crawl space) to fit in custom-cut insulation between the joists. Instead, it allows you to insulate the underfloor void by using its proprietary articulated arm, while you control the movement from the outside. 

It is very simple to use. You need to cut out an air-brick from the external wall, insert in the device, survey the subfloor conditions , and by controlling it from the outside, allowing Ufloor to do the rest of the job: to evenly spray sufficient insulation to the underside of the floor boards."

Finally, their revised approach to managing their portfolio of businesses has ensured a more robust planning approach, enabling us to allocate capital to the opportunities which are expected to deliver the most material value for shareholders.

"OptiStructure is an AI solution for the Construction Industry. The way this works in a general way is that initially the architects design on a software like Autocad the look and feel. Then the engineers take on the design to execute. A crucial part is the structural design. Structural design is the methodical investigation of the stability, strength and rigidity of structures. The basic objective in structural analysis and design is to produce a structure capable of resisting all applied loads without failure during its intended life. Structural Engineers typically use various software solutions (same as the architects use autocad for example) such as ETABS, SAP2000 etc.
After the structural engineers finish their design, OptiStructure connects to their software, takes the output and optimizes it against any variable. Most frequently the optimisation is done against cost. So far the minimum optimisation that has taken place is 10% from our solution and the maximum 37%. Imagine in a building of a skyscraper for example worth 100s millions saving even 10% is a huge number.
Currently OptiStructure is growing organically with presence in London, Dubai, Athens, San Francisco, Boston and Singapore."

This sum was eventually found from the sale of St Marychurch Town Hall and a complete refurbishment of the mechanical parts was carried out in the winters of 2005 and 2006.     Despite a previous failed attempt to sell the railway the FBCR was asked if they would become responsible for the operation and negotiations began in 2006. These proceeded very well and by September a draft lease had been prepared. At the same time various other organisations were consulted about the most suitable structure for the organisation that was to run the railway. The Consensus was to register the FBCR as a charity and to set up a Community Interest Company to carry out the running of the attraction. These processes were successful completed with the Company being set up finally in March 2008. The takeover of the railway was later beset with legal problems and eventually took place on 1 August 2009."

"MISSION

'Chasing' the Wind is on a mission to bridge the digital skills gap in order to help small businesses and like-minded professionals strategically position their branding, marketing, & advertising campaigns in order to find product-market-fit. 

VISION 

'Chasing' the Wind vision is to help Georgian's find sustainable wealth through homeownership; in turn fighting the current corporatocratic environment that has placed more emphasis on sub-optimal optimization and bottom-line profitability than empowering employees and providing total customer satisfaction through continuous improvement and quality assurance.  

CORE VALUES 

'Chasing' the Wind core values are forged in America's Founding Documents; especially the preamble to & Declaration of Independence, and earth's Wisdom Literature in order to bring US once again— under God. With Liberty. And Justice. For All. 


CORNERSTONES

'Chasing' the Wind is built on four cornerstones of sustainability : 

1. Selfless development; 

2. Bottoms-up strategic framework;

3. Total transparency, and 

4. Unquestionable ethics 


UPDATE : pandemic forced shape; since dropped 'Chasing'; DBA; `with Wind`.


RECESSIONARY ISSUES

The North American economy has seen an amazing decade of growth. Market recession was inevitable. Pandemics simply were not. 

We're convinced the conceptual models with Wind works tirelessly while continuously to further develop can be implemented and instituted on a global scale. 

Taking on North America's biggest people problems i.e. 

- bending curves, 

- closing gaps, building 

- bridging divides, 

- eradicating IT gates, and 

- fighting the systemic issues driven by selfish motivation, corruption, kickbacks, bureaucracy plus utter hypocris; while fully leveraging the most immediately impactful (in-demand real estate opportunity found in the southeastern US and rural areas of Georgia).

// Simply, helping our clients to better service their clients, and prospect.


GREAT LEAP FORWARD

Emerging technologies (AI, ML, NLP, Kubernetes, etc) continue to push the envelope. We either take this next great leap forward or further stagnate in the midst of pandemic, epidemic, overdose crisis, and machines learning realtime unconscious bias plus learned trait hate. 

- Realizing this leap will worsen the wealth gap further depleting urban conditions. Which will only worsen socioeconomic conditions for the disadvantaged and minority populations. Further expanding the ever-widening gaps which now fuel epidemic, pandemic, overdose crisis, and self-absorbed complacency in US.

"We are the first online marketplace for all things construction equipment.

The $200B+ construction equipment industry in the US is comprised of thousands of businesses that are inaccessible online. These suppliers are in desperate need of an e-commerce platform that works for them.

The problem we are working to solve starts in parts.

Contractors make 17-20 calls per week to find the parts they need. Manufacturers have billions of dollars of parts inventory sitting on their balance sheets with no channel to sell it through. Aftermarket part suppliers' core business is selling these parts yet they have no e-commerce channel. Despite the massive amount of supply and demand for this inventory, the only place to go today is Ebay.

In solving the parts problem, we are well on our way to solving the same challenges that exist in used equipment and rentals.

"Carlisle Companies Incorporated is a diversified global company with a portfolio of businesses focused on the manufacture and distribution of highly engineered products for both original equipment and aftermarket channels. 

Carlisle's markets include: commercial roofing, energy, agriculture, mining, construction, aerospace, defense, foodservice, healthcare, sanitary maintenance, transportation, industrial, protective coating and auto refinishing. 

Leveraging the Carlisle Operating System (COS) and an entrepreneurial spirit to drive continuous improvement, Carlisle's worldwide team of employees generated $3.5 billion in net sales in 2015.

Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a long and proud history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s.

With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company.

The end of the depression and the beginning of World War II forced changes upon the rubber industry. Japan cut off 95% of the natural rubber supply from the East Indies, forcing Carlisle, along with other companies, to seek other sources. In December 1945, Carlisle began to manufacture inner tubes using synthetic rubber.

Carlisle Tire and Rubber was purchased by Pharis Tire and Rubber Company in 1943 for $330,000. But significant losses followed and in 1949, the Board of Directors decided to liquidate the company. All Carlisle stock was distributed to the Pharis stockholders and the company was officially renamed Carlisle Corporation. In 1946, Carlisle purchased a company that produced molded friction products that are used on traditional brake shoes and thus began the starting point of what today is Carlisle Brake & Friction. This also ushered in a new phase for Carlisle as they began growing as a diversified manufacturing company.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Carlisle continued to acquire a variety of other companies further diversifying their product mix to include insulated wire and cable, which today is known as Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Inc. became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of “CSL.” By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products.

In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials.

In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products.

So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, Carlisle Transportation Products was formed.  In 2013, Carlisle sold its Transportation Products business.

Carlisle’s diversification efforts, both through product line extensions within its core businesses and through acquisitions, has continued to build a strong decentralized company led by entrepreneurial management teams. Carlisle continues to bring innovative product solutions to solve customers’ challenges. The Company’s family of businesses builds market leadership that creates enduring competitive advantage, and thereby add value for shareholders.

Carlisle Companies’ worldwide team of employees is focused on continuously improving the value of the Carlisle brand by developing the best products, insuring the highest quality and providing unequaled customer service in the many industries Carlisle’s Companies serve."

"Currently they are seeking funding to purchase an additional 22 building lots in Granby Ranch, Granby Colorado. They already own 5 lots with premium mountain views, infrastructure is already in place and lots are ready to build on. They have paid for design, and have Homeowner association approval which is required before permitting. the value of the currently owned lots is between $60,000 and $105,000. Neighborhood comps for 2015 average $515,000. Projected profit per home is projected at $96,800 per home.

  They have chosen this high end neighborhood due to its strong economic comeback recently. It is a 5000 acre community with almost 5000 units approved. currently there are about 525 units built. there is a mix of condos, townhouses, duplexes and single family homes. Granby Ranch has its own ski area, mountain biking, river fishing and an 18 hole golf course and clubhouse with pool and hot tub. The area is 1 1/2 hours from Denver and is located in the middle of the Rocky Mountains with staggering views. All of their lots have magnificent views across the valley and of the ski area and golf course.

  The company that was building in this neighborhood is pulling most of their resources to Denver where they hold much land that is in very high demand. They are looking to fill the need that is being left. There is no major competition left in this neighborhood at this time. This will change, but it will take time for them to get approvals and build infrastructure.

"Have you ever had the belief that if you just had some money to start a project you could be very successful? My name is Nick Montoya and I believe that with some help I can build many affordable, green, energy efficient homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I am priced significantly lower than my  competition. 

I have been in construction since 2006 and have already built over 100 houses, 52 over the past two years. My newest homes have a HERS rating of 60. To give you some idea what that means, a house with a HERS score of 70 is 30 percent more energy efficient than a standard new home.

My problem is that because of the economy, banks in Santa Fe are reluctant to lend to small builders like me. I currently have six homes pre-sold but I cannot get construction loans. I have contacted other banks, credit unions, and private investors but the interest rates they charge would make it impossible for me to build affordable homes. I still have to pay interest payments on the undeveloped land. So right now, we're struggling. That's why I decided to turn to crowdfunding.

Your donation will help me buy materials and construct the pre-sold homes. I can build 10 houses for $1 million and 5 houses for $500 thousand. Every contribution helps."

"Contour Crafting is a layered fabrication technology through which large-scale structures can be fabricated quickly in a layer-by-layer fashion, like 3D-printing a building. It reduces the cost of building a structure by minimizing the man-hours needed to manufacture it and also increases the speed at which the house can be put on the market, lowering the financing cost by allowing it to turn a profit for the builder more quickly. The process should also be much safer for construction workers than traditional building techniques, which would lower the cost of insurance for building companies.


Contour Crafting technology has great potential for automating the construction of whole structures as well as sub-components. Using this process, a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, embedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing, and air-conditioning. The potential applications of this technology are far reaching including but not limited to applications in emergency, low-income, and commercial housing.


Contour Crafting was developed by Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California."

“There has to be a better way so people can get on with their lives.”

Chris “L.C.” Nussbeck founded MADSKY out of a sincere belief that there could be a better way to address roofterior claims by creating a more automated and personalized approach. His convictions stemmed from a wealth of experience having spent more than three decades in the industry as a roofing contractor and storm restoration expert where he found himself becoming increasingly frustrated with the inefficiencies throughout the restoration process. Conventionally, roofers would secure sales by traveling door-to-door after a storm and offer their services; however, the contracts they secured often stalled or terminated due to cost upticks, unsatisfactory customer service, and inefficient timelines. With the increase and severity of weather events across the U.S., insurance companies are seeking out the MADSKY solution to better serve their customers with a holistic and personalized approach."

Its successes have resulted in producing new laws and new precedents, creating new leases to become the industry standards, devising new faster, less expensive procedures to obtain foreclosures and evictions, using “Perry Mason” moments to win trials, creating out-of- the-box ways to collect on judgments, and creating new theories of law to obtain justice for clients.

Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C. counts itself among only one of two law firms with under 30 attorneys to achieve an AV Martindale-Hubbell rating, repeated Super Lawyers ranking, selection into the Bar Registry of Preeminent Lawyers, and a Chambers & Partners award for being one of the “Leading Lawyers for Real Estate.”

Chambers & Partners named Adam Leitman Bailey as a “tenacious and confident litigator who is quick-witted in court and respected by the judges” noting that he is “an extraordinary practitioner who gets great results” and quoting a client on his “ability to anticipate things before they happen.”  “Hired to litigate extremely high-profile cases, Adam Leitman Bailey has impressed sources with his courtroom presence.” Another client told Chambers, “You feel like you have a zealous advocate out there working for you, and you never worry about things when they are in his hands.”

A New York State Judge wrote that Adam Leitman Bailey “was the best trial lawyer I saw in my nine years as a Judge in New York City.”  When Mr. Bailey’s firm used a forgotten statute to prevail in a landmark case, the Wall Street Journal quoted a prominent New York developer’s attorney who called the holding a “game changer” affecting real estate nationwide."

At SWS Environmental Services (SWS) it is their mission to set the industry standard as the nation's premier turnkey environmental services provider utilizing their knowledge, experience and unparalleled customer support. Their team of highly trained, skilled professionals is dedicated to providing solutions of unmatched value consistently with a commitment to safety, reliability and the long-term growth and success of the company.

As of June 20th, 2011, Eagle-SWS officially changed it's name to SWS Environmental Services. The new name and logo better conveys who they are and what they do.


In November of 2008 with the merger of Southern Waste Services, Inc. and Eagle Construction and Environmental Services, L.P. a change in branding and services to Eagle-SWS was unveiled.
Formerly conducting business as SWS First Response and Eagle Construction, SWS is the result of two leading environmental companies joining forces to create one of the largest environmental firms in the United States.


With an expansive range of service centers in the Midwest, the North, the South, and along the Gulf Coast, they have significantly diversified their environmental services portfolio and greatly increased their ability to respond to their clients' environmental emergencies.

With the merger of SWS completed and their new branding in full force, clients can expect a comprehensive set of environmental services available across a broad geographic area, maintaining the same commitment to safety, integrity, and customer service clients have come to expect.

What started as a small domestic waste company in the early 1970s following the deployment of vacuum trucks to a series of oil spills eventually evolved into SWS First Response, a premier emergency response and environmental services contractor. Over the course of 30 years, the company expanded across six states and also developed an entire line of environmental services including site remediation, waste transportation & disposal, decontamination, industrial services and vacuum truck services.

Beginning in 1981, Eagle Construction and Environmental Services was a small commercial construction company serving the West Texas region. After acquiring a variety of heavy equipment to meet a wide range of project needs and demands, Eagle developed into a leading full-service environmental company, providing practical environmental solutions in multiple states."

"FreeGreen offers free residential green design to create sustainable house plans.

There is an entire industry of stock plan books and plan sites. Some are created by architects and designers with talent; others are full of the usual faux manors. Very few are modern designs and fewer still are what one might call green. All of them are ripped off constantly by every builder and client who isn't willing to hire an architect and isn't even willing to pay a couple of hundred bucks for a set of plans.

David Wax and his team at Free Green turn the home design business model on its head. They are charging exactly what most people are willing to pay for design: Nothing.

And they are not bad plans at all; they say â€œGood home design comes from a collaborative effort in which aesthetics, performance, and value are constantly discussed, debated, and maximizedâ€? and it shows. They offer a fairly traditional three-bedroom 2-1/2 bath plan that would not offend anyone (having every standard feature that almost every house in North America has) and an interesting smaller ""suburban loft"" model, with the promise of many more to come- architects and designers are invited to submit plans for the catalog.

The business model: ""we offer free, downloadable, buildable energy efficient and healthy home plans to everyone. Our revenue comes from the green product vendors that we specify into the plans (via an advertising and lead generation model).""

Architects can't make money doing one-off houses and most people aren't willing to pay for it, or don't even value it. The traditional model is broken, so why not market architecture like software or blogs and give it away, making money from the ads? Finally there is a model where somebody ""looks forward to helping you [architects and designers] get the exposure and revenue you deserve.""

Their construction documents are thorough, complete with ""a Location Specific Energy Performance Report for over 200 cities across the United States, and Full Construction Document sets in 24 by 36 format (including all the details, and a LEED-H checklist for use on the job site)."""

Yardz is an online rental management software for the construction rental industry allowing renters to manage the process and track rental inventory, from comparing multiple quotes and secure rentals direct with suppliers to seeing project inventory mapped out and even receiving notification for end of rental and call-off capabilities.   

After working in the construction and equipment rental industries, the Yardz founders saw a need. They realized that it took way too long to rent equipment, especially when searching for competitive rates. The other realization was that after years of renting with a trusted supplier, even so called negotiated “discounted rates” were not actually the lowest rates out there.

We saw a problem in the industry and wanted to change it. We wanted to empower the renter again. We wanted to see free market and choice. To give construction renters their time back, giving them technology that not only benefited their work day, but saved money for their businesses and looked out for their bottom line.

Yardz believes in the sweat, grit, concrete and steel that this country was built on. We chose “Red, White and Blue” as our colors because it is in the core of who we are as people and a company. It is our traditional values that put our customers first, and the integrity we demand of ourselves drives how we do business. We look forward to the chance to show you firsthand."

As his construction business grew and became more complex, he began searching for better integrated budget management tools which would support the business processes he had developed through many years of experience.

He became familiar with the power of the internet and decided that he would leverage that power and build an integrated application that would meet his company’s needs. He assembled a team of technical resources to prototype the concepts.

The value of the product quickly became apparent and the company BuildStar Technologies, Inc. was formed to pursue the development and marketing of a product so exciting and unique that it would revolutionize construction management."

"SignOnSite provides construction companies and their workers with a simple and robust safety management system that leverages the technology in every workers' pocket. 

As construction projects increase in complexity, so do the systems that control risks to safety. These controls go wider to address the increased volume of risks, and they also go deeper to address the increased magnitude of risks. 

Safe sites require that everyone on-site participates in safety controls and processes. As complexity increases, the likelihood that these systems will be fully and correctly utilised decreases, particularly in commercial and industrial construction where hundreds of people work. The controls, processes and communications that are intended to keep people safe don't end up achieving their intended outcomes. 

SignOnSite makes these controls more effective by putting useful technology in everybody’s hands. It embeds personnel safety controls and processes inside a mobile, tablet and web platform. The traditionally separated (but related) controls of site attendance, inductions/orientations, safety briefings and evacuation management are brought together into one simple, integrated system.

The convenience and ease-of-use of the mobile app/kiosks increase the engagement, compliance and active participation of the on-site workforce. At the same time, the real-time site data from the Site Management platform empowers the people responsible for running sites, by giving them the ability to observe, control and manage sites remotely.

Used by 300,000 people on over 7,000 sites around the world, SignOnSite forms an essential part of a safe, digitally-enabled construction environment."

"HOUSL is created to take advantage of emerging technologies and improve an outdated and cumbersome rental property application process.

Utilizing a QR code that is specifically assigned to a rental property, applicants are able to scan the QR code with their smart phone while inspecting a rental property and submit an application prior to even leaving the property.

Through their web portal, agents then receive all applications for the property in one convenient place.

With Deloitte’s new greenID solution integrated into the HOUSL application process, applicants are also able to complete their 100 point ID check prior to submitting their rental application. greenID complies with the Electronic Verification requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) legislation, and is the fastest, most accurate solution available.

Through the use of these emerging technologies, HOUSL will also play a significant role in helping the environment. Currently there are approximately 15,000,000 sheets of paper used in the rental application process each year.

In order to create the 15,000,000 sheets of paper, 5,000 fully mature tree’s must be cut down and over 4 Olympic Swimming pools worth of fresh water must be used in the process of manufacturing the paper. The paper manufacturing process also puts out approximately 510 tons of Co2 into the atmosphere which is the equivalent of a single 6 cylinder car travelling 1,425,000 kilometers or 1800 round trips from Sydney to Perth.

Using emerging technologies to streamline an inefficient system and at the same time help the environment is what HOUSL is all about."

"More than 75% of civil construction companies here in Australia use pen and paper to record and track daily activities on site. This information then needs to be entered manually into spreadsheets and databases to capture important cost information. 

Can you imagine that this would still be the way companies operate in 5 or 10 years? – We at Site Diary Pty Ltd don’t -  and we want to be the ones that change it!

Site Diary is a mobile web app that is used by supervisors and engineers in the civil and engineering construction industries. It is designed specifically to record actual plant and man hours of work done out in the field along with information on materials used, subcontractor activities and progress on site.

The app can be accessed via a tablet out in the work field and is designed to make it easy, quick and painless for supervisors to record activities that happen on the work site. The information is then uploaded to an online server and can be accessed by the management staff that utilize the information to track costs and site progress.

This approach addresses the following problems:
•Making recording information less painful – by providing an easy to use online site diary.
•The need to double enter information – eliminated through synchronization of data.
•Down time for supervisors to fill out paper diaries - The Site Diary is mobile and can be done from the field."

Epanko currently has the highest grade Inferred JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (for graphite) yet to be delineated in Tanzania – 14.9Mt at 10.5% TGC, for 1.56Mt contained graphite.
